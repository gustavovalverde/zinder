//! Zinder capability strings and registry metadata.
//!
//! Every served RPC on `WalletQuery`, `ExplorerQuery`, and `IngestControl`
//! has one row in [`CAPABILITIES`]. Each row binds a capability string to its
//! surface, the fully qualified proto method it gates, and a declarative
//! [`AdvertisePolicy`]. The registry defines vocabulary, stable ordering, and
//! descriptive requirements; it does not discover the capabilities of a
//! composed wallet runtime. The `capability-table-vs-descriptor` CI guard
//! cross-checks the table against the compiled `FileDescriptorSet`. The full
//! protocol contract is in [Public interfaces §Capability
//! Discovery](../../docs/architecture/public-interfaces.md#capability-discovery).
//!
//! Capability naming follows `domain.subdomain.capability_name_v{N}`.
//! Versioned suffixes are part of the capability identity; a `_v2`
//! capability is a separate string from its `_v1` predecessor and may
//! coexist during a deprecation window.
