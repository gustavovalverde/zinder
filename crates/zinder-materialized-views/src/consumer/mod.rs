//! Materialized-view consumer traits, typed event wrappers, and in-process dispatch helpers.
//!
//! Every materialized-view consumer implements [`MaterializedViewConsumer`]. The trait is the seam
//! between the consumer-agnostic infrastructure in this crate (store and
//! typed event wrappers) and the consumer-specific aggregation logic that
//! lives in each consumer module.
//!
//! A consumer that needs the parsed block in `apply_block` does NOT fetch
//! raw block data itself. `zinder-ingest` constructs a shared
//! [`BlockCommitContext`] from the canonical commit and passes it to every
//! consumer observing that height.
