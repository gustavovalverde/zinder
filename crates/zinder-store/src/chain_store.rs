/// index with complete retained spend facts. Older stores may have swept the

/// from `address_output_index`, `transparent_output`, and
/// `transparent_spend_fact` in one maintenance batch.
///
/// The sweep covers heights from the persisted swept-through marker up to
/// `min(current safe tip, retention release height)`. The retention
/// release height is the durable-consumer floor: `zinder-ingest` publishes it
/// through [`PrimaryChainStore::set_transparent_retention_release_height`] as the
/// durable transparent-outpoint-spend projection advances, so a spend fact is
/// deleted only once that projection has recorded its spender identity. A
/// release height below the swept marker leaves the marker and the projections
/// untouched. A pass that deletes at least one fact also advances the
/// `transparent_retention_deleted_through_height` marker to the same ceiling, so
/// the startup guard can tell a real deletion apart from a checkpoint-bootstrap
/// swept marker that deleted nothing.
///
/// A single pass sweeps at most `max_heights_per_pass` heights and stops
/// after the first fully-swept height that reaches
/// `max_outpoints_per_pass`, whichever budget hits first. When the release
/// floor jumps far ahead of the swept marker (a store rebuilt with derive
/// paused, then un-paused at tip), the marker advances only to the last
/// fully-swept height and the remaining backlog drains across later passes;
/// the outpoint budget bounds the delete batch through transaction-dense
/// eras, and the height cap bounds the scan through sparse ones.
///
/// The scan runs outside the control lock so readiness and event-history
/// reads stay responsive through a bounded chunk. This is sound because
/// every row it reads is finalized: the range ends at or below the current
/// safe tip, `validate_reorg_window_change` floors every `Replace` at
/// `safe_tip + 1`, and the swept marker is written only by this sweep inside
/// the serialized writer. The locked write still re-checks the marker via
/// [`TransparentRetentionSweep::swept_marker_unchanged`] and discards the sweep on
/// skew rather than writing markers derived from stale state.
