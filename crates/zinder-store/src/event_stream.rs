//! Shared event-stream runner for resumable gRPC subscription adapters.
//!
//! One driver serves every cursor-bound event family (chain events, mempool
//! events). A family supplies a page-reader that returns the next page of wire
//! envelopes; the driver forwards them, advances the cursor from the envelope
//! it just sent, and idle-polls when the page is empty. The
//! [`EventEnvelope`] trait is the only family-specific seam the driver needs:
//! it extracts the resume cursor from a delivered envelope.
