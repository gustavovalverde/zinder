//! Intra-Zinder gRPC channel construction and keep-alive policy.
//!
//! Every long-lived gRPC channel between two Zinder services (explorer ↔
//! query, query ↔ ingest, compat ↔ ingest) is built through
//! [`connect_zinder_grpc`]. The function attaches the
//! [`BearerTokenClientInterceptor`] required by ADR-0006, configures the
//! HTTP/2 + TCP keep-alive policy that ADR-0019 requires, and returns the
//! [`AuthenticatedChannel`] callers wrap in their service-specific client.
//!
//! Direct construction of a [`tonic::transport::Endpoint`] outside this
//! module is a forbidden pattern; the structural invariant in
//! `crates/zinder-source/tests/transport_invariants.rs` will fail. New
//! cross-service plumbing reuses this function.
//!
//! Zebra-facing transports live in `zinder-source::transport`; this
//! module is intra-Zinder only, per the boundary declared in
//! `lib.rs` ("deliberately exposes no domain types") and ADR-0004.
