//! Operator-facing environment-variable contract for Zinder service binaries.
//!
//! The `ZINDER_*` env-var schema is part of Zinder's public interface (see
//! [Public interfaces §Environment variable mapping]). This module is the
//! single source of truth for the operator-facing surface: the entries in
//! [`ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`] feed both the rendered Markdown table embedded
//! in `docs/architecture/public-interfaces.md` and the CI drift test that
//! catches doc/source skew.
//!
//! [`render_environment_variable_table`] returns the Markdown the doc block
//! must contain. Tests assert exact equality; the doc-mirror integration
//! test prints the expected rendering on failure so the operator can
//! copy-paste the canonical output back into the doc.
//!
//! Adding a new env-var to a service config is a two-line change here plus
//! the corresponding field on the relevant config struct. The mirror test
//! makes drift in either direction a build failure.
//!
