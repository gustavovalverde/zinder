//! `WalletQuery.ChainEvents` server-side filter logic.
//!
//! Owns the `address_filter` semantics defined in the chain-events
//! architecture: clients pass a
//! list of transparent addresses they care about; the server narrows
//! delivered envelopes to those whose committed block range touches at
//! least one of the supplied addresses. Reorged envelopes always pass
//! through because consumers must invalidate cached derivations after a
//! reorg regardless of which addresses they watch.
//!
//! Cursor opacity is preserved: every emitted envelope carries the cursor
//! the server would have emitted without a filter. A resuming client with
//! a different filter receives an envelope set consistent with the new
//! filter applied from the cursor forward.
