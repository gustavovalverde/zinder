//! Fixed-range storage benchmark harness for Zinder.
//!
//! This crate captures immutable source fixtures, drives canonical-store range
//! replay through bulk catchup, and compares concrete `RocksDB` and `PostgreSQL`
//! round trips over the same backend-neutral canonical block facts. Each
//! measurement owns an explicit report shape so a block-local replay diagnostic cannot
//! claim a production canonical or projection lifecycle.
//!
//! The harness is a standalone binary and is not linked into production
//! services.
