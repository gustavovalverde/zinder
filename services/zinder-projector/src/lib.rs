//! Production ownership boundary for version-1 wallet projection construction.
//!
//! The release binary is the only component that opens the wallet store as a
//! primary. Canonical facts are consumed through a process-local `RocksDB`
//! secondary so projection construction cannot contend with canonical ingest.
//! After cold validation, the service keeps the wallet primary private and
//! continuously reconciles it from authenticated retained canonical events.
//! A wallet is considered ready for serving only when its persisted source
//! fence exactly matches the canonical writer fence.
