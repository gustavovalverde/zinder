# Zinder

Zinder is a self-hosted Zcash chain-data service. It indexes the chain once from a [Zebra](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra) full node, then exposes one durable, consistent, versioned view that multiple wallets and products can share. Every read pins to one chain epoch, so a sync batch never combines data from competing tips, while shielded scanning and keys remain in the wallet.

The release topology serves both Zinder's native `WalletQuery` protocol and [lightwalletd](https://github.com/zcash/lightwalletd)'s `CompactTxStreamer` protocol. Native clients use `zinder-query`; existing lightwalletd clients use the independent `zinder-compat-lightwalletd` adapter. Both pin reads to exact canonical and wallet-projection fences, and every named wallet and release still requires end-to-end certification before Zinder claims support.

## Wallet integration paths

- **Existing lightwalletd clients** keep their `CompactTxStreamer` integration
  and point it at `zinder-compat-lightwalletd`. Protocol compatibility does not
  become a named-wallet support claim until that wallet's current release
  passes end-to-end certification.
- **Native wallet clients** call the published `zinder-query` runtime for the
  epoch-pinned reads and node-backed operations admitted and advertised by that
  deployment, including compact blocks, chain events, and typed broadcast
  outcomes.
- **Rust wallet libraries and applications** use the remote-first `zinder-client` SDK. Its default `RemoteChainIndex` connects to `zinder-query` without linking Zinder's RocksDB storage stack.
- **Explorers and application backends** use epoch-consistent wallet reads plus the optional `ExplorerQuery` plane for block summaries, transaction details, mempool views, typed search, and rebuildable materialized views.

Zinder is strongest when chain access should survive one wallet process, serve
several independent consumers, or remain decoupled from a particular wallet
implementation. An embedded indexer can be simpler for one tightly coupled
wallet process, while direct Zebra RPC may be sufficient when a consumer only
needs node-owned data. See
[What Zinder is and is not](docs/architecture/indexer-wallet-boundary.md) for
the detailed comparison.

The deployment target is single-operator self-hosting backed by one Zebra node. Public endpoints sit behind operator-controlled TLS termination, authentication, rate limiting, and quota accounting.

## How Zinder compared on Testnet

On one Testnet machine, current Zinder was faster than lightwalletd-rs at
one job: copy the chain and serve the small block summaries wallets use
to catch up. Across 3 runs it took about 32% less time.

When Zinder also built its full transparent wallet index, including
address history, it was slower than lightwalletd-rs in the 1 run we
measured, because that extra index is a second pass after the chain
copy. Zinder finished that full-index job much faster than Zaino
v0.7.0 in the same 1-run test. These are Testnet results on one
machine. They are not Mainnet numbers, and they do not prove Zinder is
ready for production. The numbers and limits are in
[Testnet performance](docs/reference/testnet-performance.md).

## Quickstart

The supported wallet-serving topology uses four independent release runtimes
on one host filesystem: `zinder-ingest` owns canonical storage,
`zinder-projector` owns the wallet projection, and
`zinder-query` and `zinder-compat-lightwalletd` independently serve native and
compatibility protocols over immutable exact-fence pairs. A separate
[single-volume container target](docs/runbooks/deploying-wallet-serving.md)
runs ingest, projector, and native query as supervised processes when a host
can attach one volume to only one container; that target omits
`zinder-compat-lightwalletd` and is not a published release image. Explorer
images are also outside the release catalog.

Tagged releases also provide checksum-bound GNU/Linux bundles containing these
same 4 executables for `x86_64-v3` and AArch64 hosts. The x86 archive
requires an x86-64-v3 CPU; both archives require glibc 2.34 or newer and
dynamic `libstdc++.so.6` with `GLIBCXX_3.4.30`, with Debian 12 Bookworm as the
certified runtime baseline. Each archive is accompanied by an SPDX 2.3 SBOM
and signed SLSA provenance. Multi-platform GHCR images carry child SBOM
attestations, root provenance, and a keyless root signature; the immutable
GitHub Release binds all downloadable assets. See the
[VM deployment runbook](docs/runbooks/deploying-on-a-vm.md) for native
installation and runtime ownership requirements.

Bring up a Zebra node through the [Z3 platform stack](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/z3),
then start Zinder from this checkout:

```bash
# In the Z3 checkout.
Z3_NETWORK=testnet docker compose up -d

# In the Zinder checkout.
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env.testnet \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

The checked-in network files provide stable, non-secret projector lease
identities for one lane per network. Override
`ZINDER_PROJECTOR_BUILD_OWNER_HEX` with another 32-character hexadecimal
value before starting a side-by-side rebuild lane.

The writer becomes ready only after canonical catch-up and a complete mempool
snapshot. The projector remains unready until it has built or resumed the
current wallet-store format and reached the writer's authenticated event fence.
Each serving runtime becomes ready only after its own canonical and wallet
secondaries converge to one exact fence.

```bash
# Testnet ports use the +10000 network offset.
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19105/readyz   # ingest
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19110/readyz   # projector
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19106/readyz   # native query reader
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19107/readyz   # compatibility reader

grpcurl -plaintext -d '{}' 127.0.0.1:19102 \
  zinder.v1.wallet.WalletQuery/ServerInfo
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{}' 127.0.0.1:19067 \
  cash.z.wallet.sdk.rpc.CompactTxStreamer/GetLightdInfo
```

Both wallet-facing ports bind to host loopback. Terminate TLS, authentication,
rate limits, and quotas in an operator-controlled proxy before exposing it.
Fresh mainnet construction still requires performance, capacity, coherent
restore, and independent-client evidence. A green local Compose deployment is
not by itself production certification. The acceptance boundaries live in the
[testing runbook](docs/runbooks/testing.md) and the recovery contract lives in
[service operations](docs/architecture/service-operations.md#recovery).

For phase behavior and recovery, see
[Initial sync](docs/runbooks/initial-sync.md). For the storage and publication
lifecycle, see
[ADR-0035](docs/adrs/0035-canonical-storage-topologies.md).

## Architecture at a glance

Zinder indexes the chain once and serves one shared chain view to wallets,
applications, and explorers. Canonical data remains the source of truth, while
selected projections provide rebuildable views for specific query workloads.

The [indexer architecture](docs/architecture/canonical-materialized-view-architecture.md) explains
how canonical indexing, projection selection, and API serving fit together.

### Planes

- **Node source boundary** (`zinder-source`). Adapters normalize upstream node observations into `NodeSource` values. Authoritative chain facts enter only through this boundary; optional upstream-health checks and source-format parsing elsewhere cannot become fallback chain readers or parallel followers. See [node source boundary](docs/architecture/node-source-boundary.md).
- **Chain ingestion plane** (`zinder-ingest`). The only writer to canonical storage. Owns fresh construction, continuous following, reorg handling, the authenticated canonical event stream, and live mempool state. See [chain ingestion](docs/architecture/chain-ingestion.md), [chain events](docs/architecture/chain-events.md), and [ADR-0015](docs/adrs/0015-phase-driven-ingest.md).
- **Canonical storage** (`zinder-store`). RocksDB-backed `RocksDbCanonicalStore` and `RocksDbCanonicalSecondary` roles expose domain-shaped canonical operations. RocksDB types remain private, and readers bind to one `ChainEpoch` or `CanonicalEventFence` before reading. See [storage backend](docs/architecture/storage-backend.md) and [ADR-0003](docs/adrs/0003-canonical-storage-access-boundary.md).
- **Wallet projection and query plane** (`zinder-projector`, `zinder-query`, `zinder-wallet-*`). The projector is the sole wallet-store writer. It constructs and continuously follows the current wallet-store format at authenticated canonical event fences; the query runtime serves the native WalletQuery protocol from process-owned secondary generations. See [wallet data plane](docs/architecture/wallet-data-plane.md).
- **Compatibility plane** (`zinder-compat-lightwalletd`, optional `zinder-compat-cipherscan`). Protocol-edge adapters preserve consumer contracts without shaping Zinder's native APIs around a product. The lightwalletd adapter translates `CompactTxStreamer` onto `WalletQueryApi` through `WalletServingQuery`; the Cipherscan adapter translates REST and WebSocket contracts onto `ExplorerQuery` and `WalletQuery`. Neither owns canonical writes or parallel artifact construction. See [protocol boundary](docs/architecture/protocol-boundary.md) and the [Cipherscan adapter README](services/zinder-compat-cipherscan/README.md).
- **Explorer plane** (`zinder-explorer`, optional). Serves block summaries, transaction details, typed search, mempool dashboards, and other explorer-shaped reads through `ExplorerQuery`. It opens, reads, and serves materialized views as a secondary. `zinder-materialized-views` owns the reusable store and consumers; no release runtime writes them unless a replay host is composed separately. See [explorer plane](docs/architecture/explorer-plane.md) and [materialized-view plane](docs/architecture/materialized-view-plane.md).

Two foundation crates are shared across every plane: `zinder-core` (chain vocabulary: `ChainEpoch`, `BlockArtifact`, `Network`) and `zinder-proto` (`.proto` files and checked-in generated wire modules, including the pinned vendored lightwalletd schemas). The public Rust SDK adds the remote-first `zinder-client`; all three packages are prepared as one lockstep crates.io set, inherit the workspace Rust 1.95 MSRV, and do not require `protoc` in a consumer build. Every binary also exposes an operational HTTP surface (`/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`) with typed readiness causes; that contract is owned by `zinder-runtime`. See [service operations](docs/architecture/service-operations.md).

For the full boundary contract, read [service boundaries](docs/architecture/service-boundaries.md).

## Workspace

Domain crates under `crates/` define stable contracts with no service runtime:

- `zinder-core`: chain vocabulary (`ChainEpoch`, `BlockArtifact`, `CompactBlockArtifact`, `Network`).
- `zinder-store`: canonical storage. Owns `RocksDbCanonicalStore`, `RocksDbCanonicalSecondary`, `CanonicalEventFence`, canonical construction and follow records, plus the artifact-oriented store used by optional materialized-view components.
- `zinder-source`: upstream source adapters. Owns `NodeSource`, `NodeAuth`, `NodeCapabilities`, `ZebraJsonRpcSource`, `TransactionBroadcaster`.
- `zinder-proto`: protocol ownership. Owns `.proto` files and checked-in tonic-generated modules under `v1::wallet`, private `v1::ingest`, and vendored `compat::lightwalletd`.
- `zinder-client`: remote-first typed Rust SDK. Owns the consumer-facing chain, snapshot, capability, server-metadata, and error vocabulary over the native wallet protocol.
- `zinder-wallet-projection` and `zinder-wallet-rocksdb`: wallet projection rules, source commitments, leases, rows, and RocksDB persistence.
- `zinder-materialized-views`: independently versioned explorer materialized-view consumers and storage.
- `zinder-rocksdb-bulk-load`: RocksDB SST construction used by bulk-load paths.

The release workflow builds these deployable services:

- `zinder-ingest`: the only writer to canonical RocksDB. Owns construction, following, retained canonical events, the private control endpoint, live mempool state, and upstream-source configuration.
- `zinder-projector`: the only writer to wallet RocksDB. Owns fixed-fence construction, continuous canonical-event following, settlement, and bounded reorg reconciliation.
- `zinder-query`: serves the native `WalletQuery` gRPC protocol through `WalletQueryApi` and an exact canonical/wallet-projection serving pair.
- `zinder-compat-lightwalletd`: translates the vendored lightwalletd `CompactTxStreamer` gRPC service through `WalletQueryApi` and an exact canonical/wallet-projection serving pair.

The `zinder-query` crate also owns the internal `WalletQueryApi`,
`WalletServingQuery`, request types, shared exact-fence serving-pair publisher,
and native adapter.
`zinder-explorer` and
`zinder-compat-cipherscan` compile as optional services but are not release
images.

## Validation Gate

Run before considering any change complete:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets --all-features
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo nextest run --profile=ci
cargo nextest run --profile=ci-parity
cargo nextest run --profile=ci-perf
RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --workspace --all-features --no-deps
cargo deny check
cargo machete
git diff --check
```

`cargo nextest run` is the canonical workspace runner. Tests are tiered by directory as documented in the [Testing Runbook](docs/runbooks/testing.md): T0 unit, T1 integration, T2 perf, T3 live, and T4 consumer certification. The `default`/`ci` profile runs T0 and database-free T1; `ci-postgres` runs the externally backed PostgreSQL driver test; `ci-perf` runs T2; `ci-live` runs upstream-node T3; and `ci-parity` runs T4. `cargo test` continues to work as a libtest fallback (and is what `cargo mutants` shells), but is not the documented gate.

Heavier probes for trust-sensitive storage or parser changes:

```bash
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --all-features --no-report
cargo mutants --workspace --all-features \
  --file crates/zinder-store/src/chain_store.rs \
  --file crates/zinder-store/src/chain_store/validation.rs \
  --file crates/zinder-source/src/source_block.rs \
  --re 'chain_event_history|settled_tip_only_commit_without_artifacts|validate_reorg_window_change|from_raw_block_bytes'
```

T3 live tests use the same env-var schema as production binaries and are double-gated by `#[ignore = LIVE_TEST_IGNORE_REASON]` plus a runtime `require_live()` check. Mainnet is rejected unless tests opt in by name. To run T3 against a local Zebra:

```bash
ZINDER_TEST_LIVE=1 \
  ZINDER_NETWORK=zcash-regtest \
  ZINDER_NODE__JSON_RPC_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:29232 \
  ZINDER_NODE__AUTH__METHOD=basic \
  ZINDER_NODE__AUTH__USERNAME=zebra \
  ZINDER_NODE__AUTH__PASSWORD=zebra \
  cargo nextest run --profile=ci-live --run-ignored=all
```

For testnet, swap `ZINDER_NETWORK=zcash-testnet` and use Zebra cookie auth (the cookie file's `user:pass` split feeds `ZINDER_NODE__AUTH__USERNAME` and `ZINDER_NODE__AUTH__PASSWORD`). Mainnet live tests require an explicit mainnet opt-in as documented in the [Testing Runbook](docs/runbooks/testing.md).

## Local Observability Smoke

Use the local observability smoke when a change needs visible runtime evidence rather than only test output:

```bash
scripts/observability-smoke.sh run
```

It starts Prometheus and Grafana, runs ingest, projector, native query, and the lightwalletd compatibility service against the selected local node source, records that restore is blocked until coherent canonical-plus-wallet bundles exist, generates native and lightwalletd-compatible gRPC traffic, prints the scraped metric samples, and writes readiness reports under `.tmp/observability/reports`. See [observability/README.md](observability/README.md) for public-network commands, calibration runs, ports, tunables, and the stop command.
