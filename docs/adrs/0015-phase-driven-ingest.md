# ADR-0015: Phase-Driven Ingest

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Canonical ingest has two distinct workloads. A store far behind the upstream
tip needs bounded, pipelined construction, while a near-tip store needs serial
append and replacement handling with low observation latency. Requiring an
operator or deployment system to select one workload creates two startup
contracts and permits a cold store to run the near-tip path indefinitely.

The writer already owns the information needed to choose correctly: the local
canonical tip, the upstream tip, the reorg window, and upstream health. The
choice therefore belongs inside `zinder-ingest`, not in service wrappers or
deployment scripts.

## Decision

`zinder-ingest` runs one long-lived canonical writer and classifies work on each
iteration with `classify_phase`:

- `AwaitingUpstream` when the upstream tip is height zero.
- `BulkCatchup` when the upstream-to-store gap is greater than
  `ingest.phase_classification.catchup_threshold_blocks`.
- `FollowingTip` otherwise.

An empty store is treated as height zero. A store ahead of the observed upstream
tip saturates the gap to zero and enters `FollowingTip`, where the writer waits
for a coherent replacement observation. Phase changes are bidirectional, so a
writer can return to `BulkCatchup` after downtime without a process restart or
operator action.

Bulk catch-up fetches bounded source segments, prepares blocks concurrently,
and publishes authenticated canonical batches without crossing the configured
reorg window unless `ingest.run_overrides.allow_reorg_window_settlement` explicitly
permits it. Following-tip mode observes one coherent source update at a time and
publishes either an append or a replacement. Both paths use the same canonical
store, error classification, readiness state, and recovery policy.

The writer exposes the phase independently from readiness cause. A process can,
for example, be in `following_tip` while reporting `node_unavailable`; clients
must not infer one dimension from the other. `IngestControl.WriterStatus`
reports phase, source position, gap, and upstream-health observations.

The configuration is grouped by responsibility:

- `[ingest.phase_classification]` owns the gap boundary.
- `[ingest.construction]` owns historical construction limits.
- `[ingest.follow]` owns near-tip polling and lag limits.
- `[ingest.run_overrides]` owns bounded one-run overrides.
- `[node.health]` owns the upstream readiness probe because health is a source
  property, not an ingest-phase property.

The writer opens the primary canonical store once. The mempool owner, retention
worker, and control service share the same process lifetime and do not restart
when the ingest phase changes.

### Upstream sync detection

When `[node.health].addr` is configured, the writer polls Zebra's readiness
endpoint and treats a non-ready upstream as `upstream_not_ready`. The resolved
`NodeHealthConfig` owns the poll interval, verification-progress floor, and
estimated-gap threshold. The source adapter returns a typed
`UpstreamHealthSnapshot`; the writer owns how that observation affects
readiness and recovery. Missing, malformed, or unreachable health responses do
not become successful observations.

Without an explicit readiness endpoint, the writer relies on the source
observations available through Zebra JSON-RPC. Upstream health remains
independent from the local ingest phase in both cases.

## Consequences

- Operators run one ingest command for empty, recovering, and near-tip stores.
- Deployment configuration does not encode the writer's current phase.
- Historical throughput limits and near-tip latency limits remain separate and
  can be tuned without creating separate execution modes.
- Readiness and control-plane clients receive explicit phase and upstream-health
  data.
- Phase handlers must preserve one canonical publication and recovery contract.
