# ADR-0028: Per-Consumer Materialized-View Schema Versioning

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Materialized-view consumers own disjoint rows, cursors, and recovery sources.
A payload or key change in one consumer must not invalidate every other view.
Rebuild safety also cannot be inferred from retained chain events alone: a row
may depend on canonical inputs whose retention differs from the event log.

The versioning unit therefore needs to match the ownership and recovery unit.

## Decision

Each consumer registers one `MaterializedViewConsumerSchema` containing:

- a stable `MaterializedViewConsumerName`;
- a monotonic `schema_version`;
- the exact column families it owns.

`MaterializedViewStoreOptions::consumers` is a closed declaration set for the
opened store. Consumer names and column-family ownership must be unique. The
`consumer_metadata` family persists one manifest row per consumer with its
writer version and owned families.

### Exact schema admission

The format version and every declared manifest row are written atomically only
when creating a fresh store. Every subsequent primary open, secondary open,
and secondary catch-up require:

- the exact `MATERIALIZED_VIEW_STORE_FORMAT_VERSION`;
- an exact physical column-family set, including the shared families;
- every manifest consumer to be declared; and
- identical consumer names, column-family ownership, and schema versions.

Any lower, higher, missing, renamed, or otherwise mismatched consumer identity
fails closed before the primary opens RocksDB for mutation or any consumer row
is decoded. An operator must select a fresh materialized-view path and rebuild
it from a certified recovery source. Store open never clears consumer rows,
resets cursors, rewrites an existing manifest, or creates a missing consumer
column family.

### Container format

`MATERIALIZED_VIEW_STORE_FORMAT_VERSION` versions only the shared container:
manifest layout, cursor encoding, and shared metadata families. The running
reader defines the only admitted format.

Every opener rejects a container format different from the running format with
`SchemaMismatch`, without mutation. The operator must select a fresh path and
rebuild it from a certified recovery source; a store open never deletes an
existing materialized-view directory. Consumer key or payload changes increment
that consumer's schema version and require a fresh store.

## Consequences

- Consumer schema changes are explicit store-replacement operations rather
  than in-place migrations.
- Removing, renaming, or adding a consumer requires a fresh store; absence is
  never interpreted as permission to delete or create state.
- Recovery must use a certified source that covers the required history before
  a replacement store becomes active.
- Rollback cannot reinterpret, erase, or create any incompatible consumer or
  container format.
