# ADR-0016: Source Segment Fetching

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Historical construction needs more than a one-block source call. Per-block
round trips leave the writer idle, while an unbounded range call can exceed
source, network, or process memory limits. The source boundary also has to
detect a chain change between the caller's cursor and the returned blocks.

The canonical writer must not depend on one Zebra transport shape. It needs a
bounded sequence of connected source observations with the same semantics
whether an adapter obtains them through JSON-RPC batches or an indexer gRPC
endpoint.

## Decision

`NodeSource::fetch_chain_segment` is the bounded historical-fetch boundary. The
request carries a cursor, a maximum connected-block count, and a maximum
response size. The response contains ordered `SourceChainUpdate` values and
source payload statistics. Every adapter must:

- observe the upstream tip before selecting its range;
- return a revert update when the cursor block is no longer the selected-chain
  block at that height;
- validate that returned blocks form one parent-linked sequence;
- enforce the requested count and response-size limits; and
- return typed source errors for unavailable blocks, incoherent observations,
  protocol mismatches, and oversized responses.

`ZebraJsonRpcSource` implements the boundary with a bounded JSON-RPC batch of
height-keyed `getblock` requests. It decodes each raw block locally, validates
linkage, records observed payload bytes, and splits requests when the source or
transport rejects the response size. It does not make a preceding
`getblockhash` call: the decoded block hash and parent hash provide the required
identity and continuity checks.

`ZebraIndexerBlockSource` implements the same boundary with bounded concurrent
indexer `GetBlock` calls. It still uses the JSON-RPC control plane for tip,
tree-state, subtree-root, health, and broadcast operations that the indexer
protocol does not provide. This adapter is available as a library boundary;
the `zinder-ingest` configuration currently selects only `zebra-json-rpc` for
canonical construction.

The writer adapts segment size below
`ingest.construction.source_segment_max_blocks` using observed response bytes.
It separately bounds in-flight request count, in-flight bytes, block preparation
concurrency, and commit reassembly memory. Consensus branch changes reset the
response-density estimate.

`NodeSource::fetch_block_at` remains the one-block primitive and the default
implementation used by sources that do not override `fetch_chain_segment`.
Following-tip ingestion uses the coherent one-update path rather than assuming
that a historical segment is a live event stream.

## Consequences

- Canonical construction has one transport-neutral, resource-bounded source
  contract.
- JSON-RPC historical fetches avoid a redundant hash lookup and amortize
  request overhead across a bounded segment.
- Reorg detection is expressed as source updates and typed errors, not inferred
  from partial batches.
- Adding a configured source kind requires explicit runtime wiring and
  validation; the existence of an adapter type alone does not make it a
  supported deployment option.
