## Context

Zinder's canonical and derive stores are allowed to grow with chain history, but
their resident memory must not grow with on-disk store size. The storage layer
serves long sequential reads during startup catchup, secondary replay, and
wallet-facing scans. With buffered filesystem I/O, those reads can populate the
host page cache with large portions of the RocksDB store. In cgroup-enforced
deployments, that reclaimable page cache counts against the container memory
limit even though it is not Zinder heap or RocksDB-owned cache.

The operational invariant is therefore stricter than "set a smaller block
cache": resident memory owned by Zinder and RocksDB must be bounded by the
configured budget, and on-disk store size must not determine process RSS or the
memory-pressure signal that throttles rebuildable work.

Before this ADR revision, ADR-0020 focused on WAL growth and per-column-family
write buffers. Those controls are still required, but they are incomplete:

1. Buffered reads can fill the cgroup through the OS page cache.
2. Per-column-family write buffers do not bound total memtable memory across
   many column families.
3. A pressure signal based on `memory.current - inactive_file` still includes
   active file cache, which is reclaimable.
4. Startup catchup must not block a reader process indefinitely before
   `/readyz` can report replica lag.

## Decision

Both RocksDB users in the workspace route through one bounded open path in
`zinder-store`: the canonical store (`RocksChainStore`) and the derive store
(`DeriveStore`). The helper owns the block cache, write-buffer manager, direct
I/O resolution, and open retry policy.

### Direct I/O With Buffered Fallback

Every RocksDB open first attempts direct I/O:

- Primary and secondary opens set `use_direct_reads = true`.
- Primary opens also set `use_direct_io_for_flush_and_compaction = true` and
  `compaction_readahead_size = 2 MiB`.

If the direct-I/O open fails, Zinder logs
`event="rocksdb_direct_io_unsupported"` with the store path, role, and error,
then retries the same bounded open under buffered I/O. This keeps the default
path store-size-independent on filesystems that support direct I/O while
remaining portable on filesystems and development platforms that do not.

Successful opens log `event="rocksdb_io_mode"` with the resolved mode
(`direct` or `buffered`), store path, and role. The resolved mode is retained
beside the RocksDB handle for observability.

### Resource Budget

`RocksDbResourceBudget` is the single typed budget for canonical and derive
stores. It carries:

| Knob | Writer canonical | Writer derive | Reader canonical | Reader derive | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `block_cache_bytes` | 512 MiB | 256 MiB | 128 MiB | 64 MiB | Bounded LRU cache shared by data, index, and bloom blocks. |
| `max_wal_bytes` | 256 MiB | 256 MiB | 32 MiB | 16 MiB | Live WAL ceiling. Writer stores flush once the WAL crosses this limit. |
| `max_open_files` | 512 | 512 | 128 | 64 | Open SST handle cap so RocksDB does not pin metadata for every file. |
| `write_buffer_bytes` | 16 MiB | 16 MiB | 8 MiB | 4 MiB | Per-column-family mutable memtable size. |
| `max_write_buffer_count` | 2 | 4 | 2 | 2 | Per-column-family mutable plus immutable memtable count. |
| `max_background_jobs` | 2 | 2 | 2 (not applied) | 2 (not applied) | Primary-writer aggregate flush and compaction job cap owned by RocksDB. |
| `memtable_budget_bytes` | 256 MiB | 512 MiB | 16 MiB | 16 MiB | Total memtable memory budget across column families via `WriteBufferManager`. |

The derive writer deliberately reserves more aggregate memtable headroom than
canonical because one ordered replay dispatch writes many consumer column
families. The shared manager still enforces the 512 MiB hard bound; the larger
envelope prevents hot families from stalling behind constant flush and
compaction turnover.

Local tests use the same bounded path with a smaller profile: 32 MiB block
cache, 16 MiB WAL ceiling, 64 open files, 4 MiB write buffers, two write
buffers, a two-job primary limit, and an 8 MiB total memtable budget.

The validation gate rejects values below the minimums:

- `MIN_BLOCK_CACHE_BYTES = 4 MiB`
- `MIN_MAX_WAL_BYTES = 4 MiB`
- `MIN_MAX_OPEN_FILES = 32`
- `MIN_WRITE_BUFFER_BYTES = 4 MiB`
- `MIN_MAX_WRITE_BUFFER_COUNT = 2`
- `MIN_MAX_BACKGROUND_JOBS = 2`
- `MIN_MEMTABLE_BUDGET_BYTES = 4 MiB`

`max_wal_bytes = 0` remains invalid because it disables RocksDB's WAL-size
flush trigger.

The background-job value is a primary-writer resource limit, not a flush-policy
switch. RocksDB dynamically schedules primary flush and compaction work within
the configured cap. Writer defaults remain at RocksDB's existing two-job
posture; operators can raise a primary store only after the per-column-family
pressure and byte ticker metrics demonstrate a maintenance backlog.
`OpenAsSecondary` disables automatic flushes and compactions, so secondary
profiles retain the field at `2` in the uniform budget type but neither apply it
nor export it as an effective limit.

### Locked RocksDB Invariants

These options are storage-layer contracts and are not operator-configurable:

- WAL stays enabled.
- Point-in-time recovery stays enabled through RocksDB's default recovery mode.
- Atomic cross-CF flush stays enabled on primary stores.
- Ordered writes stay enabled.
- Index and bloom filter blocks are charged to the bounded block cache through
  `cache_index_and_filter_blocks = true` and
  `pin_l0_filter_and_index_blocks_in_cache = true`.
- The write-buffer manager handle is retained for the lifetime of the DB
  handle, alongside the block cache.

### Memory Pressure

Ingest memory-pressure backpressure uses non-reclaimable memory, not working
set. The derive replay budget computes its pressure ratio from cgroup `anon`
memory divided by `memory.high` when set, otherwise `memory.max`. If cgroup
`anon` is unavailable, it falls back to process `RssAnon` from
`/proc/self/status`.

`working_set_bytes` remains exported as a diagnostic metric, but it does not
drive derive replay throttling because active file cache is reclaimable.

### Startup Catchup

Reader startup performs bounded initial catchup. If a secondary does not
converge within `storage.initial_catchup_timeout_ms` (default 30 seconds), the
reader continues with the opened secondary view and the periodic catchup task
lets readiness report replica lag. Startup does not block indefinitely on a
far-behind secondary and does not crash-loop solely because catchup needs more
time.

## Consequences

- Store-size-independent memory is the storage contract. On supported
  filesystems, direct I/O prevents store reads from filling the cgroup through
  page cache. On unsupported platforms, the same bounded RocksDB-owned caches
  are used with buffered I/O.
- The canonical and derive stores share the same open path, so direct-I/O
  resolution, block-cache setup, WBM setup, and fallback behavior cannot drift.
- Operators tune a curated budget surface instead of raw RocksDB options.
- Rebuildable derive replay backs off only on non-reclaimable memory pressure.
  Reclaimable file cache does not pause indexing.
- Reader processes can start and expose `/readyz` while a secondary catches up.

## Alternatives considered

- **Expose a direct-I/O toggle.** Rejected. The correct operator contract is
  automatic direct-I/O detection with buffered fallback. A toggle would add a
  failure mode without changing the invariant.
- **Use only block-cache and open-file caps.** Rejected. Those bound RocksDB
  metadata and cached blocks, but do not stop buffered reads from filling the
  OS page cache.
- **Use per-column-family write buffers only.** Rejected. The total grows with
  the number of column families. `WriteBufferManager` is the cross-CF bound.
- **Keep using working-set pressure.** Rejected. `memory.current -
  inactive_file` still includes active file cache and can pause derive replay
  while the kernel could reclaim the memory.
- **Fail startup when initial catchup is slow.** Rejected. Replica lag is a
  readiness condition, not a liveness failure.

## Revision: store-size-independent memory invariant (2026-06-06)

This revision replaces the earlier WAL-replay-centered wording with the current
invariant: RocksDB-owned memory is bounded by `RocksDbResourceBudget`, store
reads prefer direct I/O with buffered fallback, total memtable memory is bounded
by `WriteBufferManager`, and memory pressure is based on non-reclaimable
anonymous memory.
