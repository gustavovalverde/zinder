## Context

Canonical chain ingestion and consumer-shaped queries have different storage
workloads. Canonical construction is an ordered, block-local write stream.
Wallet serving needs cross-block address history, unspent outputs, spends, and
bounded reorg undo. Explorer products need independently selectable aggregates.
Putting all three workloads in one foreground commit makes the canonical writer
perform historical reads and maintain indexes that are not chain truth.

The runtime also needs an explicit ownership model. A storage engine name does
not define who may write, how readers prove freshness, how a projection binds
to its canonical source, or how backup and recovery preserve a coherent pair.

## Decision

Zinder separates durable ownership into canonical storage and projection
storage.

1. `zinder-ingest` is the only canonical writer. It persists block-local
   `CanonicalBlockFacts`, direct canonical indexes, chain epochs, retained chain
   events, and control records. Canonical commits do not read wallet projection
   state.
2. `zinder-projector` is the only wallet-store writer. It constructs and follows
   wallet state from authenticated canonical event fences.
3. Reader services open process-owned secondaries. A response that combines
   canonical and wallet state uses one immutable `WalletServingReadPair`
   admitted at an exact fence.
4. Explorer aggregates use independently versioned materialized views and do
   not change the wallet or canonical contracts.

### Canonical record

`CanonicalBlockFacts` is the semantic per-block record shared by construction,
following, replay, projection, and storage diagnostics. The aggregate is
backend-neutral. Its reference digest and replay envelope are separately
versioned from every physical storage layout.

Raw block and transaction bytes are retention-policy artifacts. Typed digests
bind retained bytes to semantic facts, but the raw bytes are not embedded in
the canonical facts digest. Direct indexes are added only for canonical queries
that must not decode every replay envelope.

### Store identity

Each persisted store records its domain identity, exact schema version,
network, and the immutable parameters required by that domain. Canonical
identity also includes workload, network-upgrade activation fingerprint,
construction manifest, and reorg policy. Wallet identity binds to the exact
canonical source contract and sequence position it projects.

Openers fail without mutation when identity or version does not match. Zinder
does not adopt an unknown non-empty directory, silently reinterpret an incompatible
layout, or let a reader upgrade primary storage.

### Lifecycle ownership

Canonical construction writes an inactive candidate, validates its source
manifest and ordered digest, and publishes a baseline epoch. Canonical following
then appends or replaces the visible suffix under the fixed reorg policy.

Wallet construction pins a canonical fence, acquires a projection build lease
and a canonical retention lease, builds an inactive wallet store, validates its
source identity and digest, catches up, and publishes ready evidence. Continuous
following takes ownership before the construction leases are released.

Serving admission catches canonical and wallet secondaries up independently and
publishes a pair only when their identities and positions agree. In-flight
requests retain their original immutable pair while later requests atomically
switch to the replacement pair.

### Supported topology

The supported deployment topology is `rocksdb-single-host`:

- canonical and wallet primaries have one owner each;
- reader processes use RocksDB secondary instances with process-unique metadata
  paths;
- the primary stores live on a shared host filesystem; and
- authenticated private control APIs coordinate fences, leases, mempool state,
  and recovery operations.

The four release runtimes are `zinder-ingest`, `zinder-projector`,
`zinder-query`, and `zinder-compat-lightwalletd`. The two serving runtimes open
process-unique secondary generations over the same canonical and wallet
primaries. Native `WalletQuery` and lightwalletd compatibility are independent
protocol surfaces; neither aliases the other. Explorer and Cipherscan services
are optional workspace components, not release topology members.

PostgreSQL support in `zinder-bench` is a diagnostic persistence arm for the
same canonical replay corpus and digest oracle. It does not provide the
runtime ownership, wallet projection, wallet-serving admission, replication,
recovery, or operational contracts required for a deployable topology. Zinder
therefore does not advertise a PostgreSQL deployment mode.

### Recovery boundary

A canonical checkpoint alone is not a wallet-serving backup. Production restore
requires a coherent bundle that authenticates the canonical fence and wallet
digest together, restores both stores into fresh paths, and passes wallet-serving
admission before traffic becomes ready. Independently timed directory copies do
not prove this contract.

## Consequences

- Canonical throughput is independent of historical wallet index lookups.
- Wallet and explorer schemas can change or rebuild without redefining chain
  truth.
- Each store has one unambiguous writer, and readers cannot mutate primaries.
- Readiness reflects exact source and projection agreement, not merely open
  sockets or individually healthy stores.
- A second storage engine requires a complete topology implementation, not a
  generic database adapter or a successful persistence microbenchmark.
- Operators must place the supported primary stores on one host filesystem and
  preserve separate secondary metadata paths per reader process.

## Rejected alternatives

### One schema for canonical, wallet, and explorer data

This couples canonical progress to every consumer workload and makes projection
schema changes part of the chain-truth storage contract.

### Per-service canonical writers

Multiple canonical writers create competing visibility and reorg authorities.
Zinder keeps one writer and distributes authenticated events instead.

### Generic database adapter

RocksDB and PostgreSQL have different transaction, replication, bulk-load, and
recovery mechanics. Domain-shaped APIs remain stable while engine-specific
modules own physical behavior. Shared abstractions are introduced only when two
supported implementations prove the same boundary.

### Mixed storage-engine deployments

Per-plane engine mixing multiplies backup, readiness, failover, and support
combinations. A future topology must define one coherent application contract
for all required stores and runtimes.
