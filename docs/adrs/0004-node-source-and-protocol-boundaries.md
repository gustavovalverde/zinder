# ADR-0004: Separate Node Sources from Protocol Surfaces

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Upstream-node integration and Zinder's service protocols are adjacent but
independent boundaries. If they share types or ownership, a transport DTO can
leak into canonical storage, query handlers can acquire hidden node fallbacks,
and compatibility schemas can shape native domain APIs.

## Decision

Zinder keeps two explicit owners:

1. `zinder-source` owns upstream-node communication behind `NodeSource`,
   `MempoolSource`, `ChainTipNotificationSource`, and
   `TransactionBroadcaster`.
2. `zinder-proto` owns service protobufs, vendored compatibility protobufs, and
   generated Rust protocol modules.

Source adapters return normalized Zinder values and `SourceError`, never
transport DTOs. Capability discovery is behavior-based through
`NodeCapabilities`; an upstream version string is diagnostic information, not
the compatibility contract. Consensus-critical bytes are parsed with
Zebra-compatible primitives inside the source boundary.

`zinder-proto` owns these wire families:

- `zinder_proto::v1::wallet` for the native `WalletQuery` contract;
- `zinder_proto::v1::explorer` for the optional `ExplorerQuery` runtime;
- `zinder_proto::v1::ingest` for canonical-writer, projector, and ingest
  control services;
- `zinder_proto::v1::ops` for shared operational messages; and
- `zinder_proto::compat::lightwalletd` for the vendored
  `CompactTxStreamer` compatibility contract.

Domain and storage crates do not expose generated protobuf types in their
public APIs. Storage-private control encodings may live in `zinder-store` when
they are not service contracts.

`zinder-compat-lightwalletd` translates `WalletQueryApi` semantics into
the vendored lightwalletd contract. It does not build missing canonical
artifacts or mutate canonical storage. Its explicitly configured edge calls
may broadcast a transaction, discover network-upgrade activations, or fill
sparse tree state through `zinder-source`; none can substitute for indexed
history.

## Consequences

- Upstream transports can change without changing wallet or explorer APIs.
- Native protocol vocabulary is not copied from compatibility protocols unless
  the concepts are identical.
- Query and adapter services fail explicitly when required canonical data is
  unavailable; they do not query the node as a fallback.
- Each new protocol message and source capability has one clear owner.
