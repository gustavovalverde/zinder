## Context

A Zinder store bootstrapped near the upstream-node tip can satisfy basic lightwalletd smoke probes and a new-wallet happy path, then fail later when a wallet asks for historical artifacts. Android SDK and Zodl expose the issue first, but the gap is not Android-specific: the same wallet data-plane needs appear across the local ecosystem.

- `lightwalletd` exposes `GetTreeState`, `GetSubtreeRoots`, `GetAddressUtxos`, and `GetAddressUtxosStream` as first-class `CompactTxStreamer` methods.
- Zallet's `wallet` code fetches birthday tree state at `birthday - 1`, loads Sapling and Orchard subtree roots from index `0`, and polls transparent UTXOs for wallet-owned transparent receivers.
- Full-node wallets and native Rust applications need snapshot semantics for atomic reads above the settled tip, whether they consume the `WalletQuery` wire protocol or the typed `ChainIndex` client.

The architectural risk is treating one wallet as the design center. App-specific
patches would leave Zinder without a durable consumer contract. The opposite
risk is becoming lightwalletd: compatibility is necessary, but it is not
Zinder's native product identity.

## Decision

Zinder's durable product boundary is a **consumer-neutral wallet data plane**:

- Canonical artifacts are indexed once by `zinder-ingest`.
- Native consumers use typed, epoch-pinned Rust or gRPC surfaces.
- `zinder-compat-lightwalletd` is an adapter over the same stored artifacts.
- External wallet compatibility is a coverage contract, not an app-specific workaround.

The core contract is:

1. Serve compact block ranges from canonical artifacts.
2. Serve tree state for explicit block anchors.
3. Serve subtree roots by shielded pool and subtree index.
4. Serve transparent UTXOs by address set and start height.
5. Preserve chain consistency through `ChainEpoch` and snapshot-like request pinning.
6. Report readiness and artifact availability truthfully.

### Wallet-serving coverage

`wallet-serving` is the operator-facing coverage profile for stores intended to serve wallet flows. It means the store was built with enough historical artifact coverage for wallet creation, recovery, rescan, imported-account, and transparent-UTXO flows supported by the published API.

`wallet-serving` is not a Zodl profile and not a lightwalletd profile. It is the conservative store posture for wallet consumers. It retains complete non-genesis canonical history. Shielded activation heights are sufficient for shielded tree data, but they cannot bound transparent history: a transaction mined at any later height can spend an output created before the earliest shielded activation. Complete history lets the global transparent projection resolve every predecessor without an unauthenticated prefix-state shortcut.

Serving coverage fails closed:

- `wallet-serving` rejects explicit `from_height` and `checkpoint_height` overrides.
- An existing or staged READY store is rejected when its immutable retained-history floor is later than the floor required by the current invocation. Following cannot repair omitted history; operators must rebuild the canonical and wallet stores.
- `wallet-serving` rejects `allow_reorg_window_settlement`; a serving store must stop bulk catchup outside the configured reorg window and let `tip-follow` ingest the replaceable suffix.
- Missing artifacts remain `ArtifactUnavailable`. Query services do not synthesize responses from upstream nodes, with one bounded exception: `tree_state_at(height)` fills from the configured upstream node on a cache-miss (see the tree-state-at-height carve-out under Tradeoffs).
- Readiness does not claim production traffic is safe before secondary catchup and writer-status validation have established the reader's state.

### Compatibility and native surfaces

`zinder-compat-lightwalletd` implements `CompactTxStreamer` semantics as an
adapter. It preserves lightwalletd field names and wire behavior, but it does
not own storage, query semantics, or product vocabulary.

`WalletQuery` is the native protocol integration direction. Rust applications can use `zinder-client::ChainIndex`, while consumers that cannot link Zinder's Rust crates can generate their own client from the wire contract. Native method names, typed errors, and epoch-pinned variants may diverge from lightwalletd when that improves DX, UX, or AX. Compatibility and native-client readiness are validated separately.

### Naming

Use these terms consistently:

- `wallet birthday`: the user or wallet-provided lower bound for recovery/setup.
- `scan range start`: the start of a scanner-selected range.
- `tree-state anchor`: the block height whose tree state initializes a scan, commonly `scan_range_start - 1` or `birthday - 1`.
- `artifact coverage floor`: the earliest height or index available for an artifact family.
- `serving store`: a store built with `wallet-serving` coverage and caught up by `tip-follow`.

Do not use `birthday` as shorthand for every historical tree-state lookup. Many tree-state requests are scan anchors, not wallet birthdays.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Compatibility work has one general target instead of app-specific exceptions.
- Operators get one clear serving profile: build a serving store, then run readers against it.
- Wallet failures caused by insufficient historical coverage become deployment/readiness failures, not hidden query fallbacks.
- Native consumers get a typed surface without inheriting lightwalletd's wire vocabulary or, when using generated stubs, Zinder's internal dependency graph.
- Agents reason about coverage by artifact family and anchor height instead of guessing which wallet flow caused a lookup.

Negative:

- Initial serving stores are larger and slower to build than recent-checkpoint fixtures.
- Local test workflows use explicit disposable stores or tip-follow rather than near-tip settled-tip bulk catchup.
- Full prevention of excessive transparent-UTXO materialization across many addresses requires a deeper multi-address store API; the aggregate response budget bounds the read until that lands.

Tradeoffs:

The bulk-catchup floor is intentionally conservative. A future profile can narrow coverage once the product has real demand for bounded historical ranges, but the first stable profile optimizes for correct wallet behavior and low operator ambiguity.

Upstream-node fallback is rejected. It would blur the source of truth, make readiness lie, and turn query services into partial node proxies. Repair tools may use upstream nodes to rebuild canonical artifacts, but public query methods read stored artifacts only.

Tree-state-at-height carve-out: `tree_state_at(height)` may fill from the configured upstream node on a cache-miss, mirroring lightwalletd's `GetTreeState` (which itself proxies `z_gettreestate` to the node). Zinder stores only sparse tree-state checkpoints (one per 100 blocks plus batch ends) because it delegates all commitment-tree math to the node; a wallet running the canonical `zcash_client_backend` scan loop needs the tree state at exact range boundaries that rarely land on a stored checkpoint. The fill is gated on an explicitly supplied source (the same `ZebraJsonRpcSource` snapshot ADR-0004 already permits for broadcast), is read-only against the store, and returns the exact requested height. This does not blur the source of truth: the node is the source of truth for tree state, and the stored checkpoints are a warm cache in front of it. Without a configured source the read serves only stored checkpoint heights and returns `ArtifactUnavailable` for the gaps.

## Out of Scope

- App-specific endpoint behavior.
- A separate per-wallet coverage profile.
- Public by-address shielded queries.
- Mempool UTXO completeness; the mempool surface owns mempool indexing.
- Cross-host read-replica architecture.
