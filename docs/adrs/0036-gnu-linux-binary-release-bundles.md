## Context

Container images are appropriate for the supported Compose topology, but they
are not the most direct installation surface for operators who supervise native
processes. A downloadable binary is useful only when its runtime catalog,
architecture baseline, ABI requirements, build identity, and archive bytes are
explicit and reproducible.

## Decision

Every stable or prerelease tag produces two GNU/Linux archives:

- `x86_64-v3-unknown-linux-gnu`, built for the x86-64-v3 CPU baseline; and
- `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, built for the Armv8-A baseline.

Each archive contains exactly the four runtime catalog executables from
`deploy/release-images.json`: ingest, projector, native query, and lightwalletd
compatibility. Benchmark, explorer, Cipherscan, and code-generation binaries
are excluded. The archive root also contains `BUILD-INFO.json`, `LICENSE`,
`README.md`, and an internal `SHA256SUMS`.

The release build uses Rust 1.95.0, explicit GNU target triples, an embedded
full commit, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, disabled Cargo incremental state, and remapped
source paths. Files are sorted with the C locale, owned numerically by UID/GID
0, assigned fixed modes, timestamped with the tag commit time, and compressed
with `gzip -n`. Each platform is built twice with independent Cargo target
cache scopes and no Docker layer cache; binary and archive hashes must match.

RocksDB and its compression dependencies retain the existing static-link
policy. GNU libc and `libstdc++.so.6` remain dynamic runtime dependencies. The
release checker rejects unresolved libraries, GLIBC symbols newer than
`GLIBC_2.34`, and GLIBCXX symbols newer than `GLIBCXX_3.4.30`, then runs version
and help probes in a clean supported Debian runtime. `BUILD-INFO.json` binds
the version, tag, commit, target, platform, libc and CPU baselines, source
epoch, and every binary hash and size.

## Consequences

- Operators can install the same four-process topology without extracting a
  container image.
- x86 hosts must support x86-64-v3; the filename makes that requirement
  visible before execution.
- Binary release failure blocks crates.io authentication and every image
  registry write.
- Stable and prerelease tags produce the same platform catalog, preserving the
  complete prerelease suffix in filenames and build metadata.

## Deferred work

Musl builds are a separate portability product and are not aliases for these
GNU artifacts. Artifact signing, SBOMs, and attestations are defined separately
by [ADR-0037](0037-release-artifact-provenance-and-sboms.md).
