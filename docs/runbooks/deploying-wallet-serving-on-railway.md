# Railway wallet-serving deployment

This target serves the native `WalletQuery` protocol from one Railway service.
Railway attaches one volume to one service and has no shared network
namespace, so `zinder-ingest`, `zinder-projector`, and `zinder-query` run as
three supervised processes in one container over the volume mounted at
`/var/lib/zinder`. The canonical and wallet primaries keep one owner each and
the reader opens process-unique secondary generations, as
[ADR-0035](../adrs/0035-canonical-storage-topologies.md) requires.

This target does not serve the lightwalletd compatibility protocol and is not
the certified complete release topology. Use
[Deploying on a VM](deploying-on-a-vm.md) for the four-runtime topology, and
[Railway canonical-writer validation](deploying-on-railway.md) for isolated
canonical evidence.

## Target admission

The Railway build requires:

```text
RAILWAY_DOCKER_TARGET_STAGE=zinder-wallet-serving-runtime
```

`deploy/railway.wallet-serving-runtime.toml` builds
`deploy/Dockerfile.railway-wallet-serving`; see [Deploy](#deploy) for how the
service selects it. The closed default target fails the build.

## Service configuration

Attach one persistent volume at `/var/lib/zinder`. Size it for canonical data,
the wallet projection, checkpoint staging, the reader secondaries, and
chain-growth reserve. Fresh wallet construction also spills its sorters to a
staging directory beside the wallet store, so leave headroom for that.

Provision at least 8 GB of memory. All three processes share one memory cgroup,
so the baked configs pin every budget that would otherwise be derived from it:

| Process | Bounded budget | Largest term |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `zinder-ingest` | ~2.6 GiB | canonical and materialized-view writer stores |
| `zinder-projector` | ~2.7 GiB while building, ~1.2 GiB while following | wallet-build sorters |
| `zinder-query` | ~0.4 GiB | canonical secondary block cache |

The remainder covers allocator overhead, gRPC buffers, and task stacks. In a
smaller container the cgroup OOM-killer takes one process during construction.
That terminates the whole container, and the restart resumes construction from
the last durable fence only to be killed again.

Set these variables on the service:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `RAILWAY_DOCKER_TARGET_STAGE` | `zinder-wallet-serving-runtime` |
| `PORT` | `9106` |
| `ZINDER_NETWORK__NAME` | `zcash-testnet` or `zcash-mainnet` |
| `ZINDER_NODE__JSON_RPC_ADDR` | `http://zebra.railway.internal:18232` |
| `ZINDER_NODE__AUTH__METHOD` | `cookie` |
| `ZINDER_NODE__AUTH__COOKIE` | the inline `user:password` cookie string |
| `ZINDER_PROJECTOR__BUILD_OWNER_HEX` | a stable 32-character hexadecimal value |

These are optional:

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `ZINDER_NODE__INDEXER_GRPC_ADDR` | Enables the streaming mempool source and chain-tip wakeups, such as `http://zebra.railway.internal:8155`. |
| `ZINDER_INGEST__REORG_WINDOW_BLOCKS` | Sets the canonical replacement depth, applied identically to the projector and the query surface. |
| `RUST_LOG` | Log filter, such as `info,zinder=info`. |
| `INGEST_CONTROL_BEARER_TOKEN` | Ingest-control bearer secret. Generated at boot when unset. |
| `CHECKPOINT_BEARER_TOKEN` | Checkpoint bearer secret. Generated at boot when unset. |

Only the `[network]` and `[node]` fields are shared by all three processes.
Every process rejects a `ZINDER_*` variable naming a section it does not own,
and the entrypoint delivers the two role-scoped variables above to their owner
alone. Add no other role-scoped variable. Storage paths, listen addresses,
control endpoints, and bearer token paths are fixed in
`deploy/config/railway-wallet-serving/`.

`PORT` names the port Railway healthchecks. It must stay `9106`, the
operational endpoint of the query process.

## Deploy

Railway reads `railway.toml` at the repository root unless the service names
another file. That default builds the ingest-only canary image, so set the
config-as-code path once on the service settings page:

```text
/deploy/railway.wallet-serving-runtime.toml
```

The same setting is `railwayConfigFile` on the service API. Until it is set,
every deploy of this service builds `deploy/Dockerfile.railway-nocache` and
fails its target-admission guard.

Then deploy the exact reviewed revision and name it in the message:

```bash
railway up \
  --service zinder-wallet-serving \
  --environment production \
  --detach \
  --json \
  --message "<subject> (<commit>)"
```

## Ports

| Port | Surface | Reachability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 9102 | native `WalletQuery` gRPC | Railway private network |
| 9106 | query operational HTTP | Railway private network and healthcheck |
| 9100 | ingest control gRPC | container loopback |
| 9101 | projector control gRPC | container loopback |
| 9105 | ingest operational HTTP | container loopback |
| 9110 | projector operational HTTP | container loopback |

The private network is IPv6-only, so clients reach
`<service>.railway.internal:9102`. Only the query process binds beyond
loopback; the two control planes stay private to the container.

## Fresh-sync behaviour

A fresh volume constructs canonical storage before the wallet projection, and
serves nothing until both complete. Canonical construction has a three-hour
production gate and wallet construction has a two-hour gate, so several hours
without a serving surface is the expected first-deploy shape, not a stall.

Each phase carries its own deadline: three hours for canonical construction,
two for wallet construction, thirty minutes for the serving pair. An expired
phase logs the plane's last `/readyz` body and exits non-zero, so the reason
reaches the deploy logs before Railway's six-hour healthcheck window closes.
The volume is retained and the next attempt resumes from the durable fence
rather than starting over.

A cause that no amount of waiting clears (`schema_mismatch`,
`node_capability_missing`, `reorg_window_exceeded`) ends the container as soon
as a plane reports it, instead of consuming the phase deadline.

Tell the three phases apart from the deploy logs:

| Log line | Phase |
| --- | --- |
| `starting canonical construction` | `zinder-ingest` is building or following canonical storage. |
| `starting wallet construction` | Canonical storage is ready and `zinder-projector` is building or following the wallet projection. |
| `starting wallet serving` | Both writers are ready and `zinder-query` is admitting a serving pair. |
| `wallet serving is ready` | The native `WalletQuery` surface answers. |

While a phase waits, the entrypoint repeats the plane's whole `/readyz` body
every five minutes, which carries the cause, the ingest phase, and the heights.

A plane that answers logs `http <status>: <body>`. A plane that does not answer
has no body, so the entrypoint logs `unreachable: <class> (curl exit <code>)`
instead. The class separates a stalled process from one that refuses traffic:
`connect_timeout` and `total_timeout` mean the process accepted or failed to
accept within the probe bounds and never completed the response,
`connection_refused` means no listener is bound, and `connection_reset` and
`empty_reply` mean the listener dropped the exchange.

From a shell in the container (`railway ssh`), each plane reports separately:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9105/readyz
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9110/readyz
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9106/readyz
```

Canonical readiness proves the writer and mempool contract only. Wallet
readiness proves the projection. Serving readiness proves an admitted
canonical and wallet pair at an exact fence, and it is the only one that
proves a client can be answered.

## Failure handling

The container terminates with a non-zero status when any of the three processes
exits, when a plane reports a cause that requires an operator, or when a plane
stops admitting traffic for an hour. The restart policy is `ALWAYS` with no
retry cap, so a surviving subset never keeps answering requests it cannot
satisfy and the platform never stops restarting a crash loop.

Liveness alone does not prove the topology advances, so the supervisor polls
all three `/readyz` endpoints as well. A canonical writer that meets a reorg
deeper than `ZINDER_INGEST__REORG_WINDOW_BLOCKS` drains its readiness and parks
without exiting, and its readers keep publishing a self-consistent pair at the
frozen height. Treating `reorg_window_exceeded` as terminal makes the container
restart, meet the same reorg, and restart again until an operator reconciles
the canonical store. That crash loop is the intended outcome: the alternative
is a `WalletQuery` surface answering from a chain that stopped advancing.

Upstream outages and sync lag drain readiness the same way but clear on their
own, so they are tolerated for an hour before the container terminates.

Railway sends `SIGTERM` on redeploy and stop. The entrypoint forwards it to the
query, projector, and ingest processes in that order and waits twenty seconds,
inside Railway's thirty-second drain window. It exits zero once all three stop,
and non-zero naming the survivors if any still holds a RocksDB instance open
when the window expires.

## Boundaries

- Do not label this target as the complete version-1 production topology; it
  omits `zinder-compat-lightwalletd`.
- Do not attach a second service to this volume. The canonical and wallet
  primaries have exactly one owner process each.
- Do not set role-scoped `ZINDER_*` variables beyond the two the entrypoint
  scopes to their owner.
- Do not expose 9100, 9101, 9105, or 9110 beyond the container.
- Do not attach a public domain to 9102. The native surface is plaintext;
  public exposure requires TLS, authentication, and quotas at a reverse proxy.

[Public interface configuration](../architecture/public-interfaces.md#configuration).
