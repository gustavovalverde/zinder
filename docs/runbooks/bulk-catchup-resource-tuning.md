# Bulk-catchup resource tuning

This runbook covers current memory, I/O, and concurrency controls for canonical
construction and materialized-view replay. Zinder bounds RocksDB resources and
construction queues by default; tune them only against observed pressure from
the target deployment. The resolved output from `zinder-ingest --print-config`
is the authoritative configuration for a running binary.

## Diagnose the constrained resource

Start with the process exit and the metrics immediately before it:

- Exit code 137 or a cgroup OOM event means the process exceeded the container
  memory boundary. Confirm with the platform event stream rather than inferring
  from a missing application error.
- `zinder_ingest_bulk_pipeline_queue_bytes{stage}` and
  `zinder_ingest_bulk_pipeline_reorder_buffer_bytes{stage}` identify source,
  preparation, and reassembly backlog.
- `zinder_store_block_cache_usage_bytes`, `zinder_store_wal_bytes`, and
  `zinder_store_rocksdb_property` separate cache pressure, WAL growth,
  memtables, compaction debt, and write stalls. Split these series by
  `store_role` because canonical and materialized-view stores share the ingest
  process.
- `zinder_ingest_materialized_view_replay_budget_state{state}` and the replay
  batch gauges show when projection work has degraded or paused to protect
  canonical ingest.

Do not tune all limits together. Record one pressured stage, change its owning
limit, and compare throughput and peak memory on the same chain range.

## Construction controls

The `[ingest.construction]` section owns canonical construction concurrency and
queue admission:

- `source_segment_max_blocks` is a hard request-shape ceiling.
- `source_segment_target_response_bytes` is the adaptive source-response target
  and must not exceed `node.max_response_bytes`.
- `source_fetch_max_in_flight_requests` and
  `source_fetch_max_in_flight_bytes` bound active source requests and completed
  response backlog.
- `block_prepare_concurrency` bounds CPU preparation slots, while
  `block_prepare_memory_watermark_bytes` admits their estimated and measured
  resident data.
- `commit_reassembly_max_queued_artifact_bytes` bounds completed artifacts
  waiting for ordered commit.
- `canonical_batch_max_*` fields bound one canonical commit batch.

The byte watermarks use container-aware defaults when a cgroup v2 memory limit
is available. Explicit TOML or `ZINDER_INGEST__CONSTRUCTION__*` overrides win,
but they are diagnostic controls rather than required production settings. Keep
the source watermark at least as large as `node.max_response_bytes`; startup
rejects a configuration that cannot admit its first source request.

For memory pressure, first lower `block_prepare_concurrency`, then lower the
stage watermark that metrics identify. Raising concurrency without raising the
corresponding byte budget increases contention and does not create additional
admission capacity.

## RocksDB budgets

`[storage.canonical.rocksdb]` and `[storage.materialized_views.rocksdb]` merge
role-specific overrides onto bounded writer or reader defaults. The shared
`RocksDbResourceBudget` controls block cache, WAL ceiling, open files, write
buffers, aggregate memtable memory, and background jobs. Reader defaults are
smaller; canonical reader cache size is also container-aware.

Preserve these invariants:

- WAL stays enabled for crash recovery.
- point-in-time WAL recovery fails closed on corruption;
- writes remain ordered;
- cross-column-family flushes remain atomic;
- secondaries do not become compaction or flush owners.

Raise `max_background_jobs` only when pending compaction bytes or write-stall
metrics prove that compaction is the bottleneck and the host has spare CPU and
I/O. Raising caches or memtables to hide an undersized container merely moves
the failure boundary.

## Materialized-view replay

`[ingest.materialized_views]` owns replay-specific pressure behavior. The
default `canonical-first` policy pauses rebuildable materialized-view work while
canonical ingest is under memory pressure. `replay_batch_blocks` is a maximum;
the runtime shrinks the effective batch at `memory_degrade_ratio`, pauses at
`memory_pause_ratio`, and resumes only after usage falls below
`memory_resume_ratio`.

During canonical bulk catchup, the phase gate keeps replay paused regardless of
the pressure policy. After canonical reaches the upstream tip, replay must cover
that tip before the historical-work gate opens.

## Recover after resource exhaustion

Stop the restart loop, correct the container limit or the pressured stage's
configuration, and restart the same owner against the same storage paths. The
bounded RocksDB open path replays the WAL within the configured resource
envelope. Do not delete individual WAL or SST files.

If startup reports `SchemaMismatch`, `StoreCorruption`, a network mismatch, or
an invalid canonical/materialized-view pair, resource tuning is not the remedy.
Follow [Initial sync](initial-sync.md) and create a fresh, empty pair of storage
paths. Preserve the rejected paths for diagnosis until the replacement is
ready.
