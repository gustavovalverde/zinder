# Wallet Data Plane

The wallet data plane is the part of Zinder that wallets and wallet-like applications call. It is not a wallet and must not become one by accident.

## Responsibility

The `zinder-query` crate owns the wallet request, adapter, and error contract,
and its binary serves the native `zinder.v1.wallet.WalletQuery` protocol.
`zinder-projector` owns the durable wallet state.
`zinder-compat-lightwalletd` separately serves wallets that require the
lightwalletd protocol. Both wallet-facing runtimes are deployed and admit
independent secondary generations at the same canonical fence contract.

Per [ADR-0005](../adrs/0005-consumer-neutral-wallet-data-plane.md),
this plane is consumer-neutral. Mobile SDKs, lightwalletd clients, native
full-node wallet adapters, and Rust libraries exercise different public
contracts, but they all depend on the same canonical artifact families. Compatibility adapters may
preserve lightwalletd wire names; the core vocabulary stays on artifact coverage,
tree-state anchors, chain epochs, and typed errors.

It should provide:

- Compact block range APIs.
- Visible-tip block and chain metadata APIs.
- Transaction lookup APIs where compatible with Zcash wallet expectations.
- Tree state APIs required for wallet sync.
- Sapling and Orchard subtree root APIs required for batched wallet scanning.
- Transparent-address output APIs required by lightwalletd/Zodl compatibility,
  backed by the stored transparent output artifact family.
- Transaction broadcast.
- Chain-event subscription per [Wallet data plane §Chain-Event Subscription](wallet-data-plane.md#chain-event-subscription).
- Mempool snapshot and mempool-event subscription per [ADR-0007](../adrs/0007-mempool-topology-and-retention.md).
- `ServerInfo` capability descriptor per [Public interfaces §Capability Discovery](public-interfaces.md#capability-discovery).
- Optional compatibility endpoints for lightwalletd clients.

It should not provide:

- Spending-key custody.
- Viewing-key custody.
- Seed phrase storage.
- Server-side shielded wallet scanning.
- Address ownership inference for shielded users.
- Compliance or identity logic.

## Privacy Boundary

A wallet-facing indexer can still leak metadata. Zinder must treat wallet API design as a privacy boundary.

Required privacy rules:

- Do not require shielded users to reveal spending keys or viewing keys.
- Do not add server-side address scanning as a convenience feature.
- Keep request logs free of sensitive wallet identifiers where possible.
- Document which API calls can reveal interest in a height range, transaction, or address-like value.
- Support deployment behind privacy-preserving transport where operators need it.

## Compact Blocks

The compact block builder belongs to ingestion. The wallet data plane serves compact block artifacts through `ChainEpochReadApi` or through a query-owned store fed by canonical artifacts.

Compact blocks are stored as the structured, consumer-neutral
`CompactBlockArtifact` defined by `zinder-core`. Native WalletQuery response
builders and the lightwalletd adapter translate that one semantic artifact at
their protocol boundaries. The durable format is versioned independently from
either RPC schema, so compatibility message changes do not redefine canonical
wallet facts.

This avoids two problems:

- Query-time construction can mix chain views under concurrent reorgs.
- Wallet traffic can force expensive upstream node reads or artifact derivation.

If a compact block artifact is missing, `zinder-query` should return a typed unavailable error or readiness failure. It should not fetch the block from the upstream node and build a one-off response.

The native wallet protocol slices expose latest block metadata, compact block ranges, checkpoint tree-state reads, latest checkpoint tree-state reads, subtree roots, lightd-compatible network metadata, and the chain-event subscription described below as generated `zinder_proto::v1::wallet` responses. Each response carries the cross-plane `ChainView` at field tag 1; wallet responses fill `chain_view.chain_epoch` with the epoch used to answer the read and leave the materialized-view axes unset (see [ADR-0011](../adrs/0011-explorer-freshness-envelope.md)). Native gRPC streams compact block ranges as `CompactBlocksInRangeChunk` messages so range size is bounded by request limits and not by a single gRPC response message. `WalletQueryGrpcAdapter` serves the generated native `WalletQuery` tonic service over `WalletQueryApi` through `grpc/native.rs` response builders and preserves the same epoch binding, unavailable-artifact, and range limit behavior.

A request pins a chain snapshot with `optional uint64 at_epoch_id`: absent resolves to the visible epoch at request time; present resolves the canonical epoch by id. The store keys the epoch by id, so a pinned read either resolves it or returns `CHAIN_EPOCH_PIN_UNAVAILABLE` when the id is no longer retained. `ChainEpoch` is a response-only descriptor nested in `ChainView`; the request never echoes the epoch body.

## Full Blocks

Full-block-scanning wallets parse whole serialized blocks for inline transparent
detection and shielded trial-decryption, so the native wallet protocol defines
consensus-serialized block reads alongside the compact-block surface.
`FullBlock(height, at_epoch_id)` returns one serialized block, and
`FullBlocksInRange(start, end, at_epoch_id)` streams
`FullBlocksInRangeChunk` messages. The admitted serving-pair query implements
both operations directly over canonical `BlockBlobArtifact` rows.

The range pins one admitted pair for the entire stream and repeats its
`ChainView` at field tag 1 on every chunk. Pair rotation cannot change or close
that in-flight read because the driver retains the pair's `Arc`; a later
request using an expired epoch receives `CHAIN_EPOCH_PIN_UNAVAILABLE` and must
reacquire its whole workflow snapshot. The request is bounded to 1,000 blocks.
The driver walks it in 16-block multi-get sub-reads and forwards through a
four-item channel as the client drains, so per-stream memory tracks one
sub-read plus bounded channel depth rather than the whole window.

Full-block support is derived from authenticated persisted retention, not a
runtime profile. Ingest writes block blobs only when `storage.raw_blob_policy =
"all"`, and query must declare the same value when admitting its canonical
secondary. An admitted `All` endpoint advertises
`wallet.read.full_block_at_v1` and `wallet.read.full_block_range_v1`; `None`
and `Transactions` endpoints omit both, and direct calls fail with the precise
missing-capability precondition. A missing blob inside an `All` store is an
`ArtifactUnavailable` integrity or coverage outcome, not an invitation to
fetch history from the upstream node. Changing a non-empty store to `All`
requires a rebuilt store and blue-green cutover.

Tree-state storage preserves upstream node JSON at canonical checkpoints and the
latest committed tip. The native read surface is
`tree_state_at(height, at_epoch_id)` and `latest_tree_state_checkpoint(at_epoch_id)`.
`tree_state_at` serves the tree state at exactly `height`: a stored checkpoint
when one exists there, otherwise a cache-fill from the configured upstream node
(mirroring lightwalletd's `GetTreeState`), so the returned height always equals
the requested height. The fill is the one query path permitted to contact an
upstream node, gated on an explicitly supplied source (see ADR-0005). Without a
source the read serves only stored checkpoint heights and returns
`ArtifactUnavailable` for the gaps. Lightwalletd compatibility returns a
`TreeState` response for `GetLatestTreeState`; `GetTreeState(BlockID)` is a clean
passthrough to `tree_state_at` and serves any height the upstream can answer.

Subtree roots are also wallet-sync artifacts. Query and compatibility services
must serve them from epoch-bound indexed state and must distinguish a valid empty
range from a not-yet-available upstream node subtree index.

The native query path makes that distinction without upstream node repair or
query-time compact-block decoding: it reads `ChainTipMetadata` from the same
`ChainEpoch` to decide whether a subtree index can exist, then reads stored
`SubtreeRootArtifact` values for completed roots. Missing completed roots
return a typed unavailable error; ranges beyond the completed subtree count
return an empty response.

## Block Identity and Hash-Keyed Reads

Height remains the primary key for compact-block reads. Wallet scanning is
height-ordered, compact-block ranges are height-bounded, and the canonical store
keeps those reads cheap and predictable. Do not turn compact-block range APIs
into hash-driven scans.

Zinder ships a canonical best-chain hash-to-height resolver through the typed
[`zinder_core::BlockSelector`] enum (`Height(BlockHeight) | Hash(BlockHash)`).
The resolver is backed by the `block_hash_index` column family in `zinder-store`:
every committed block writes a hash-to-height entry, and read paths treat that
entry as a hint until the canonical header at the recorded height proves the
same hash is still visible. A missing, displaced, or stale entry never resolves
to the replacement block at that height; the native API reports that the
requested block is not in the best chain.

The native surface is `WalletQuery.BlockIdBySelector` (capability
`wallet.read.block_id_by_selector_v1`) returning `BlockIdResponse { chain_view,
block_id }`. Compat hash-only requests (`GetBlock`, `GetTreeState`,
`GetTransaction`-by-block-hash) call the resolver before reaching the existing
height-keyed read; height-only callers get a normalized `BlockId` with the
resolved hash. Both the gRPC adapter and `zinder-client::ChainIndex` expose
`block_id_by_selector(BlockSelector)`.

The same resolver backs the typed block-header read model:
`WalletQuery.BlockHeaderBySelector` (capability
`wallet.read.block_header_by_selector_v1`) returns `BlockHeaderResponse {
chain_view, block_header }` where `BlockHeader` is the Zinder-native
header shape (block identity, previous hash, merkle root, commitment bytes,
block time, bits, nonce, version). The shape does not re-export Zebra's
JSON-RPC `getblockheader` object or the lightwalletd compact block header. The
header is read at request time from the typed `BlockHeaderArtifact`; raw block
bytes are not part of the normal wallet read path. If repeated reads become
the larger cost, the implementation should improve the typed header row rather
than reintroducing raw-block parsing.

Both the temporary primary-store query and the release serving-pair query
resolve height and hash selectors. Height selectors read canonical headers;
hash selectors use the canonical hash index and verify the header at the
indexed height. The release composition therefore advertises
`wallet.read.block_id_by_selector_v1`.

The release composition does not advertise
`wallet.read.block_header_by_selector_v1`. The current native `BlockHeader`
message omits the Equihash solution and is not a consensus-complete header
contract. Consumers that require the complete serialized header read a
retained full block and decode its header instead; method presence alone does
not justify a capability claim.

`BlockSelector` is `#[non_exhaustive]`. Non-best-chain `(txid, block_hash)`
lookup is a *separate method*, not a third selector arm. That form is a
non-best-chain transaction lookup and has different retention, secondary-reader,
and explorer semantics than ordinary wallet sync. `Transaction` /
`TransactionStatus` answers against the visible canonical chain plus the live
mempool; a non-best-chain lookup must add its own named API surface.

## Transaction Status and Enrichment

Native transaction lookup returns typed transaction status. The public Rust shape is
`zinder_core::TxStatus` and the native gRPC surface mirrors it through
`WalletQuery.Transaction(TransactionRequest) returns (TransactionStatusResponse)`
under capability `wallet.read.transaction_by_id_v2`. The response carries the
shared `TransactionLocation` oneof on its `location` field; the oneof has two
arms. `NotFound` is gRPC `NOT_FOUND`, not an oneof slot, because typed errors do not consume oneof variants:

- `mined`: `MinedTransaction { MinedBlockLocation location; MinedTransactionChainContext chain_context; bytes raw_transaction_bytes }`.
- `in_mempool`: `MempoolEntry { string transaction_id; string auth_digest; bytes raw_transaction_bytes; CompactTransactionData compact_transaction_data; uint64 first_seen_unix_millis; ChainEpoch first_seen_chain_epoch; repeated TransparentMempoolOutput transparent_outputs; repeated TransparentMempoolSpend transparent_spends }`.

`TransactionLocation` is one message defined in `wallet.proto` and embedded by
every read surface that answers "where does this transaction live", including
`ExplorerQuery.TransactionDetail`, so a consumer writes one match shape for both
planes.

The mined variant carries epoch-bound `MinedTransactionChainContext {
consensus_branch_id, block_time, confirmations }`. These fields are
response/read-model values, not persisted transaction-artifact fields.
`MinedTransactionChainContext::from_response_epoch(epoch, mined_height, consensus_branch_id,
block_time)` is the **only** public constructor in `zinder-core`. Callers
cannot construct `MinedTransactionChainContext` without the response's `ChainEpoch` in scope,
so the racy `tip_height - block_height` confirmations computation is
prevented by construction. `consensus_branch_id` is resolved from the
process-startup `Arc<NetworkUpgradeActivations>` discovered via
`ZebraJsonRpcSource::discover_network_upgrade_activations()`: callers invoke
`activations.consensus_branch_id_at(height)`, which returns
`PRE_OVERWINTER_BRANCH_ID` for heights below the earliest activation. The
service binary refuses to start when `[node]` is not configured, so the
field always reflects a real node-discovered table at request time; see
[ADR-0008](../adrs/0008-network-parameter-discovery.md). `block_time` is
read from the stored `BlockHeaderArtifact` and falls back to `0` only when the
typed header row is unavailable.

`WalletQuery.NetworkUpgradeActivations` exposes that same immutable,
node-discovered schedule to native wallet backends under capability
`wallet.read.network_upgrade_activations_v1`. Each row carries the consensus
branch id, node-reported name, and activation height. Wallets compare it with
their configured consensus parameters before opening or migrating wallet state;
they derive active versus pending status against the epoch-pinned latest block
rather than trusting a second node query.

The mined arm may also carry `raw_transaction_bytes`: the serialized consensus
transaction bytes, symmetric with the mempool arm's live bytes. The field is
gated separately by `wallet.read.transaction_bytes_v1` because it is not
unconditionally present. Ingest writes canonical transaction blobs only when
`raw_blob_policy` is `transactions` or `all`; under `none`, typed transaction
location and enrichment remain available while mined bytes are absent. The
bytes come from the same `TransactionBlobArtifact` the canonical reader
resolves and are not a separate RPC. A consumer requiring the serialized mined
form preflights both `wallet.read.transaction_by_id_v2` and
`wallet.read.transaction_bytes_v1`.

A response builder must not call the upstream node or latest tip again during
response construction.

The epoch rule is stricter for mempool. An `at_epoch_id` transaction lookup is a
canonical chain read and never consults live mempool state. A non-epoch-pinned
lookup may fall through to the writer-owned mempool index after the canonical
chain returns `NotFound`.

Each native wire response shape pairs to one capability string. The capability records the semantic shape; a change to the response shape requires a new capability string, even when the RPC name stays the same.

## Chain-Event Subscription

Wallet sync needs durable chain-state notifications. `WalletQuery.ChainEvents` is the native subscription that delivers `ChainEventEnvelope` messages to wallet clients in `event_sequence` order, settled by [Wallet data plane §Chain-Event Subscription](wallet-data-plane.md#chain-event-subscription). Chain ingestion already produces these envelopes at every canonical commit; this RPC is the wire boundary that exposes them to wallet clients without requiring them to poll latest-block metadata or infer tip changes from unrelated stream lifecycles.

The contract:

- Each `ChainEventEnvelope` carries the cross-plane `ChainView` at field tag 3 (`chain_view`). `chain_view.chain_epoch` is the epoch visible after the event, and `chain_view.chain_epoch.settled_tip.height` is the settled tip height that was true for the event. The envelope carries no separate `settled_tip_height` field.
- The cursor is the `StreamCursorTokenV1` bytes documented in [Chain events](chain-events.md). Clients persist the exact bytes returned in the previous envelope and resume strictly after that cursor.
- The request carries a required `EventStreamStart start` oneof per [ADR-0027](../adrs/0027-event-stream-start-positions.md): `after_cursor` resumes strictly after the supplied cursor, `earliest_retained` replays from the retention floor (the bootstrap path for a fresh wallet install), and `live_tail` resolves once at subscribe time to a server-minted head cursor so only events applied after subscription are delivered. An unset start is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
- With `after_cursor`, the cursor's encoded family is authoritative; a non-default request `family` that disagrees is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. `earliest_retained` and `live_tail` resolve within the request's `family` field.
- The server emits historical events first (replay phase) and then continues with live events in one ordered sequence; clients see no transition.
- Stream end means the consumer disconnected or the server is shutting down. It never means a new block arrived. Clients must distinguish stream end from stream error and reconnect with their last persisted cursor in both cases.
- An expired cursor returns the typed `EventCursorExpired` error and does not silently restart from the current tip.

`ChainCommitted` and `ChainReorged` are the two event variants. `ChainReorged` carries both the reverted range and the replacement range, so a wallet receiving a reorg event truncates its local view at the reverted boundary and resumes from the replacement range without making additional indexer calls. If a client reconnects with a cursor whose branch was reorged out, the server resolves the fork point from the cursor's back-spaced locator against the canonical block index and delivers a `ChainReorged` envelope before resuming, synthesizing it when the real reorg event has aged out of retention. A wallet recovers from a reconnect reorg without a full re-derive and never observes silent branch changes. A divergence deeper than the locator cap degrades to the typed `EventCursorExpired`. See [ADR-0025](../adrs/0025-chain-event-reconnect-reorg-locator.md).

Two cursor varieties are advertised under capability string `wallet.events.chain_v1`: `Visible` and `Settled`. Visible consumers receive every envelope including reorgs. Settled consumers receive only non-reorg commits entirely at or below the settled tip. The settled cursor family is represented in the cursor body, not by a separate RPC.

The lightwalletd compatibility shim does not expose this subscription. The vendored `CompactTxStreamer` proto has no equivalent method, and ADR-0004 forbids inventing parallel surfaces in the compat layer. Wallet clients on the lightwalletd contract use `GetLatestBlock` polling, while native Zinder clients use the subscription contract.

## Mempool Snapshot and Subscription

Mempool surfaces are owned by [ADR-0007](../adrs/0007-mempool-topology-and-retention.md), which records the source, live index, event log, API, compatibility, retention windows, metrics-only diagnostics, and exact-tip readiness prerequisite.

The unconfirmed-transaction contract serves several Zcash ecosystem products,
but each product consumes a different boundary. This table is the canonical
product map; reference documents carry the line-numbered source evidence and
observed wallet-run details.

| Consumer shape | Zinder relationship | What the mempool surface enables | Required boundary |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Native full-node wallet adapter | Native `WalletQuery` consumer | Typed transaction lifecycle, rebroadcast decisions, transparent unmined UTXO updates, and chain-tip notifications separate from mempool stream lifecycle | Generated `WalletQuery` client or `RemoteChainIndex`, depending on whether the consumer can link `zinder-client` |
| Rust wallet library or application | Native typed client | Chain events, mempool state, transaction status, and broadcast behind the application's own wallet abstractions | Public `RemoteChainIndex` plus `EndpointBackedIndex` over `zinder-query` |
| Lightwalletd-compatible wallet | Compatibility consumer | Existing SDK mempool observation, pending-send feedback, shielded mempool scanning, and transaction submission behavior | `zinder-compat-lightwalletd` mapping `GetMempoolStream` and `GetMempoolTx` over the native mempool index and event log |
| Block explorers and analytics | Application or `zinder-explorer` consumers | Live mempool pages, pending transaction lifecycle, pending transparent address/outpoint overlays, and "mempool in sync" status | Native `WalletQuery` or replayable `zinder-explorer` views; full explorer parity also needs transparent history and balance |
| Zebra | Upstream node source, not a Zinder client | Keeps wallet and explorer indexing outside the node while reusing Zebra's verified mempool observations | `zinder-source` consumes Zebra `MempoolChange` when available, or falls back to `getrawmempool` polling |

Three architectural consequences follow from that map:

- The canonical path is `NodeSource -> MempoolSourceEvent -> MempoolIndex + durable mempool event history -> WalletQuery -> adapters`. Compatibility methods translate over that path; they do not own their own mempool cache.
- Source observations must become hydrated `MempoolEntry` records before they reach public APIs. Zebra's streaming mempool event carries transaction hash and auth digest, so raw transaction fetching and compact-transaction construction belong in the source/ingest path, not in `zinder-compat-lightwalletd`.
- The native mempool surface does not inherit lightwalletd's stream-close lifecycle. `MempoolEvents` stream end means disconnect or shutdown. Chain-tip changes are delivered through `ChainEvents`.
- The public server-observed type is `MempoolEntry`, not `PendingTransaction`. A pending transaction is a wallet-local UX state: it can include a transaction that was created locally but never accepted by the network.
- Product readiness claims are boundary-specific. Native method coverage proves an adapter can be written, not that a wallet integration has landed. Lightwalletd readiness requires compatible methods plus SDK or app validation, while explorer readiness requires the mempool surface plus the transparent history and balance surfaces needed for address-oriented views.

The native protocol exposes two complementary mempool methods:

- **`WalletQuery.MempoolSnapshot`** returns a bounded, pageable point-in-time view of the live mempool index, bound to the visible `ChainEpoch` at call time. The response's certified `source_tip` exactly equals `chain_view.chain_epoch.visible_tip` by height and hash. The writer returns `UNAVAILABLE` rather than a stale or misleadingly empty answer while the source generation is hydrating or its tip differs from the canonical fence. The response also carries `snapshot_age_millis`, measured from certification of the current source generation even when the certified mempool is empty, so clients with strict freshness needs can choose to subscribe to `MempoolEvents` when the age exceeds a threshold. It also carries `events_resume_cursor`, an opaque `MempoolEvents` `after_cursor` value anchored at the last mempool event the writer had applied when the walk began ([ADR-0027](../adrs/0027-event-stream-start-positions.md)). The resume cursor is identical on every page of one paged walk and empty when the writer had applied no event yet (consumers then subscribe with `earliest_retained`). Replaying from it is at-least-once; consumers apply events idempotently. Paging uses the standard opaque, HMAC-authenticated `StreamCursorTokenV1` under its `SnapshotPage` family (offset-49 nibble `0x5`): the next-page `bytes` carry the walk's anchor event position and the last yielded transaction id. A tampered cursor returns `SNAPSHOT_PAGE_CURSOR_INVALID`; a cursor anchored ahead of the mempool-event sequence the writer has applied returns `SNAPSHOT_PAGE_CURSOR_EXPIRED`. There is no separate snapshot-cursor codec.
- **`WalletQuery.MempoolEvents`** is a server-streaming subscription that mirrors Zebra's `MempoolChange` semantics: typed `Added`, `Invalidated`, `Mined` envelopes with cursor-resume via the `StreamCursorTokenV1` mempool-event family. The request carries the same required `EventStreamStart start` oneof as `ChainEvents`; `live_tail` resolves to the newest retained envelope's cursor at subscribe time.

`Invalidated` is not optional. If the polling backend observes a txid disappear
from `getrawmempool` without a corresponding block commit, it emits
`Invalidated { reason: Unknown }` or a more specific reason when the source can
prove one. Silently dropping a txid would make the mempool cache insert-only and
break rebroadcast and pending-transaction views.

Mempool retention is two-tier (60 minutes mined / 24 hours invalidated by default, both configurable). Expired cursors return `MempoolEventCursorExpired` with `oldest_retained_sequence` in `PreconditionFailure` detail.

### Mempool Point Lookups

`MempoolSnapshot` is the bootstrap and bounded-enumeration surface. It is not
the long-term contract for every non-Rust client that wants a single transaction,
address, or outpoint answer. Native gRPC exposes focused point lookups that
mirror the `ChainIndex` methods:

- `WalletQuery.Transaction` returns the typed `TransactionStatusResponse`
  carrying the shared `TransactionLocation` oneof
  (`mined`/`in_mempool`, with `NotFound` mapped to gRPC `NOT_FOUND`).
- `WalletQuery.TransparentMempoolOutputsByAddress` (capability
  `wallet.mempool.transparent_outputs_by_address_v1`) returns unmined
  transparent outputs that fund one transparent address.
- `WalletQuery.TransparentMempoolSpendsByOutpoint` (capability
  `wallet.mempool.transparent_spends_by_outpoint_v1`) returns the unmined
  spends of a batch of transparent outpoints; outpoints with no unmined
  spend produce no entry.

The mempool live state is in-memory and not chain-epoch-pinnable; both
responses bind to `chain_epoch` visible at lookup time and the requests do not
take an `at_epoch_id` field. Cap rules: `optional max_entries` defaults to a
server constant, and values larger than the server's hard cap are silently
clamped.

These methods read the writer-owned `MempoolIndex` through the `IngestControl`
proxy path settled by [ADR-0007](../adrs/0007-mempool-topology-and-retention.md).
They do not open a second mempool source and do not reconstruct a local live
index inside `zinder-query`. The native adapter parses the public
`AddressLookup` (string or script-hash form) at the public boundary and
forwards a normalized script-hash-only request to `IngestControl`; the
private writer-side handler rejects the address-string arm because the
adapter is the only client.

The transparent-address mempool methods are explicitly transparent-only: the
privacy boundary forbids by-address shielded queries, and clients scan mempool
compact-transaction payloads locally for shielded interest.

`MempoolMinedEvent` carries `transaction_id`, `mined_height`, and `block_hash`.
Block hash is source-driven enrichment: the source backends extract the mined
block hash from the upstream node's observation (Zebra streaming
`MempoolChange::Mined` plus `getrawtransaction`, JSON-RPC polling
`getrawtransaction`'s `blockhash` field) so the live mempool owner publishes
authoritative bytes without a chain-store-not-yet-caught-up race. Consumers
that track a pending transaction through mining receive the full mined block
identity in one cursor delivery.

The lightwalletd compat shim maps `GetMempoolStream` and `GetMempoolTx` over
`MempoolEvents` and `MempoolSnapshot` when the adapter is configured with the
mempool surface. `GetMempoolStream` streams the current snapshot walk's
contents first, then subscribes `MempoolEvents` with
`after_cursor = events_resume_cursor` for live delivery; the composition is
at-least-once, matching lightwalletd-go semantics. The shim also races the
stream against retained `ChainEvents` after the first page's `chain_epoch.id`;
a change already observed during stream startup closes the stream immediately
instead of being discarded. A compatibility runtime without that concrete
surface returns a typed unavailable response from the lightwalletd methods.
It does not publish or interpret the native Wallet capability descriptor;
native discovery remains owned by `zinder-query`.

## Transparent Address Outputs

Transparent-address output queries are not shielded scanning. They reveal
transparent addresses that are already public on chain, but they still must be
served from epoch-bound indexed artifacts. `GetAddressUtxos` and
`GetAddressUtxosStream` map over
`WalletQueryApi::transparent_address_unspent_outputs`,
backed by the canonical transparent address output and transparent spend artifact
families in `zinder-store`.

The compatibility shim must not answer these methods by scanning compact blocks
on demand, calling upstream nodes, returning synthetic empty results for unknown
indexed state, or materializing an unbounded address result before truncating
it. Missing indexed state is a readiness or artifact-availability failure; it
is not a reason to bypass the wallet data plane.

`GetLightdInfo.taddr_support` is `true` only when the adapter is explicitly
configured to advertise transparent-address support, transaction blobs are
retained, and both wallet projections cover the canonical tip. Transparent
output reads themselves remain available from canonical artifacts when raw
payload retention is `none`, but lightwalletd transparent transaction history
returns raw transaction bytes and therefore requires `raw_blob_policy` to be
`transactions` or `all`. The flag is a product contract for lightwalletd
clients, not a way to silence Android SDK logs.

The native `WalletQuery` proto exposes the same artifact-backed read through
one server-streaming RPC, `TransparentAddressUnspentOutputs`, which streams
`TransparentUnspentOutputsChunk` messages. The server walks the address-output
projection once at a single pinned chain epoch and emits the `ChainView` as one
leading header message (`chunk.body.header`), then one `TransparentUnspentOutput`
per unspent output (`chunk.body.item`); `start_height` is the wallet-birthday
floor. The single header makes the stream-wide single-epoch guarantee
structural: the epoch is carried once, never repeated on every item. There is
no cursor and no entry cap on the wire: a stream that is always complete cannot
be truncated by a client that ignores pagination. The request consumes the shared `AddressLookup` oneof
that accepts either a 32-byte `script_hash` (typed clients) or a base58
transparent `address` (CLI, tests, debug callers); the native adapter parses
string addresses through `ZebraTransparentAddress`, validates the network,
and SHA-256-hashes the `scriptPubKey` before any in-process call. The request
also carries the standard `optional uint64 at_epoch_id`: absent resolves
against the live visible tip; present pins the unspent read to a specific
chain epoch, so the stream is snapshot-consistent with the other canonical
reads. The Rust `ChainIndex` trait carries the same surface:
`transparent_address_unspent_outputs(query)` keyed by the typed
`TransparentAddressScriptHash`, with `query.at_epoch_id:
Option<ChainEpochId>` threading the pin. The release `zinder-query` composition
advertises `wallet.address.transparent_unspent_outputs_v1`: its admitted wallet
projection serves the complete ascending set from the same immutable
`WalletServingReadPair` as the canonical epoch header. The current query
materializes that complete set before gRPC emission; end-to-end incremental
delivery remains tracked in
[#62](https://github.com/gustavovalverde/zinder/issues/62). Compatibility
runtimes own their separate lightwalletd admission and resource bounds.

`TransparentAddressTxIdsInRange` streams `TransparentAddressTxIdsChunk`
messages with the same one-shot header shape: one leading `ChainView` header
(`chunk.body.header`), then one `TransparentAddressTxId` per indexed
transaction (`chunk.body.item`). The chain epoch is carried once on the header,
not on every item.

Cursor cadence on the tx-history streaming surface: the wire emits the resume
cursor only on the terminal item of a server stream. Non-terminal
`TransparentAddressTxId` items carry empty `cursor` bytes; the last item
carries either the next-page cursor (when more entries may be available) or
empty bytes (stream fully drained). Clients that lose the connection mid-stream
must restart the page rather than resume from a non-terminal item; bounded
history pages keep that restart cost small.

Operators must only publish a `zinder-compat-lightwalletd` deployment with
`taddr_support=true` when the serving process explicitly opts in after opening
a store with transaction blobs retained and both
`transparent_address_transaction_history` and `transparent_outpoint_spend`
covering the canonical tip. The wallet-serving coverage profile
(`ingest.run_overrides.coverage = "wallet-serving"` or `zinder-ingest --wallet-serving`) is
the supported way to select transaction retention and complete non-genesis
canonical history. A
recent-checkpoint or tip-bootstrapped store may have the address-output index
family enabled but still lack the historical rows needed by wallet birthdays and
resync anchors; that deployment posture is not wallet-serving.

`GetAddressUtxos.maxEntries` is an aggregate response budget across the
requested address set. The compatibility adapter may make several internal
artifact reads to satisfy the request, but the public response and stream must
be deterministically ordered and capped as one result set. `maxEntries = 0`
uses the adapter's configured default bound rather than becoming an unbounded
query.

## Transparent Address Tx History

Transaction-history reads return the txids that touch a given transparent
address within an inclusive height range. The native surface is
`WalletQuery.TransparentAddressTxIdsInRange`, a server-streamed page-bounded
read; the matching Rust API is
`ChainIndex::transparent_address_tx_ids_in_range`. Its `at_epoch_id` is a
client-side response expectation rather than a wire field. The client rejects
a mandatory stream header from another epoch with
`ChainEpochPinUnavailable`; snapshots set the expectation from their captured
epoch, including for empty pages.

The release query advertises `wallet.address.transparent_history_v1` for its
ascending, page-bounded wallet-projection read. Its opaque cursor carries the
exact `WalletCanonicalSourceIdentity` that issued the page, so pair replacement
fails with `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. The capability does not admit newest-first
iteration. Only the terminal chunk carries a non-empty resume cursor.

The compatibility adapter implements `GetTaddressTxids` and
`GetTaddressTransactions` through `WalletServingQuery`. That path reads
the transparent history already present in the admitted wallet projection,
alongside the canonical half of the same `WalletServingReadPair`; it does not
depend on the optional materialized-view store. Its ascending page cursor binds
the wallet row key to the exact `WalletCanonicalSourceIdentity` that issued the
page. If the publisher installs another serving pair between pages, resumption
fails with `FAILED_PRECONDITION` instead of combining rows from two sources.

The full projection path is the canonical worked example in
[Extending artifacts §A worked example: transparent address transaction history](extending-artifacts.md#a-worked-example-transparent-address-transaction-history).

## Transparent Prevout Resolution

Transparent output resolution turns an `OutPoint` (a `(transaction_id, output_index)` pair) into the `TxOut` that funds the referenced input. Two paired RPCs cover both chain views:

- `WalletQuery.TransparentOutputsByOutpoint(TransparentOutputsByOutpointRequest) returns (TransparentOutputsByOutpointResponse)` resolves outpoints against the canonical chain. Capability `wallet.read.transparent_outputs_by_outpoint_v1`. The legacy primary-store library handler reads first-class `transparent_output` rows from `zinder-store`; pinned reads verify the row's producing-block identity against the requested epoch. The release serving-pair query omits the capability until it implements the same resolver.
- `WalletQuery.TransparentMempoolOutputsByOutpoint(TransparentMempoolOutputsByOutpointRequest) returns (TransparentOutputsByOutpointResponse)` resolves outpoints against the writer's live mempool index, sharing the canonical surface's response shape so consumers decode both surfaces through one path. Capability `wallet.mempool.transparent_outputs_by_outpoint_v1`. The handler reads `MempoolEntry.transparent_outputs` directly through `MempoolIndex::transparent_outputs_by_outpoints`; no parsing at read time because the mempool ingest path pre-extracts transparent outputs at admission time. The wallet adapter proxies the call through the `IngestControl` private endpoint since secondary readers cannot observe live writer state.

Every response binds to a `ChainEpoch` (canonical: the read's epoch; mempool: the writer's epoch visible at lookup time), then carries `repeated TransparentOutputEntry entries` in input order. Each entry has the request's `OutPoint` and an `optional TransparentOutput prevout`; absence means the canonical chain at the bound epoch (canonical) or the live mempool index (mempool) does not have the referenced output. The inner `TransparentOutput` carries `value_zat: uint64` and `script_pub_key: bytes`; identifying fields stay on the entry's `outpoint` so the inner payload carries no redundant fields. Duplicate request outpoints emit duplicate entries.

The shared `OutPoint` proto message is the canonical wire-level outpoint shape across every wallet-plane RPC keyed by `(transaction_id, output_index)`. `TransparentMempoolSpendsByOutpoint` and the prevout-resolution surfaces use the same message; future outpoint-keyed RPCs reuse it without inventing parallel shapes. The coinbase sentinel outpoint (`transaction_id = 0x00..00`, `output_index = u32::MAX`) is rejected at the wallet adapter rather than carried as a magic value.

Both methods cap the request at `MAX_TRANSPARENT_OUTPUTS_PER_REQUEST = 1024` outpoints. Requests above the cap are silently truncated to the first 1024 entries. The coinbase sentinel (`transaction_id == [0u8; 32] && output_index == 0xFFFFFFFF`) is rejected with gRPC `INVALID_ARGUMENT` at the wallet adapter; consumers filter coinbase inputs at the request boundary.

The `ChainIndex` Rust API exposes `transparent_outputs_by_outpoint(outpoints, at_epoch_id)`, while `EndpointBackedIndex` exposes `transparent_mempool_outputs_by_outpoint(outpoints)` without an epoch pin. Both return `TransparentOutputsByOutpointResponse`, and `RemoteChainIndex` maps them to the native gRPC methods. The released serving-pair `WalletServingQuery` does not yet implement the canonical outpoint resolver, so `zinder-query` does not advertise that capability; consumers must preflight it instead of inferring support from the Rust method's presence.

The prevout-resolution surface is native-only. `CompactTxStreamer` has no prevout endpoint, and inventing a parallel surface is forbidden by [Service boundaries §Anti-Patterns](service-boundaries.md#anti-patterns).

## Transparent Reverse-Spend Resolution

Reverse-spend resolution is the inverse of prevout resolution: given an `OutPoint`, it returns where that output was spent rather than the output itself. This is the getspentinfo-equivalent surface. Two RPCs cover the canonical and mempool chain views; a full getspentinfo composes both (this RPC for confirmed spends, the mempool RPC for unmined):

- `WalletQuery.TransparentSpendsByOutpoint(TransparentSpendsByOutpointRequest) returns (TransparentSpendsByOutpointResponse)` resolves outpoints to their confirmed spend, arbitrarily far back: the answer is durable, not scoped to the reorg window. The legacy primary-store library handler reads the `transparent_spend_fact` table through the epoch-bound `transparent_spend_facts_by_outpoints` reader; pinned reads (`at_epoch_id`) verify each spend's producing-block visibility against the requested epoch. Canonical misses are union-routed to the durable `transparent_outpoint_spend` materialized view per [ADR-0029](../adrs/0029-durable-transparent-outpoint-spend-projection.md). That projection derives the spent outpoint and spender identity from the child transaction input plus its mined location, so a child retained above a checkpoint still records a spend whose parent output is below it. Parent-output hydration is not required. A projection hit is surfaced only when its spend settled at or below the pinned epoch's settled tip and its stored block hash still matches the retained canonical header at that height, so a row from a reorged-out branch never surfaces as the spender. If canonical retention has deleted spend facts above the projection's durable height, the read refuses with `MATERIALIZED_VIEW_UNAVAILABLE` instead of answering incompletely. If real deletion has occurred but the query handle has no materialized-view store, the same error prevents an ambiguous miss from becoming an absent spender. A store that never deleted a fact keeps the canonical-only absent semantics. The release serving-pair query omits this capability until it composes the equivalent canonical-plus-projection resolver.
- `WalletQuery.TransparentMempoolSpendsByOutpoint(TransparentMempoolSpendsByOutpointRequest) returns (TransparentMempoolSpendsByOutpointResponse)` resolves outpoints to their unmined spend in the writer's live mempool index. Capability `wallet.mempool.transparent_spends_by_outpoint_v1`.

The canonical response binds to a `ChainEpoch`, then carries `repeated TransparentSpend spends`. Each `TransparentSpend` carries the request's `spent_outpoint`, the `spending_transaction_id` (RPC byte order), the `input_index` of the spend within the spending transaction, and a `BlockTip spending_block` (height plus RPC-form hash of the block that mined the spend). The spent output's value and script are intentionally omitted: a consumer wanting them already has `TransparentOutputsByOutpoint`. Outpoints with no spend visible at the bound epoch and no durably recorded spender produce no entry; consumers key results by `spent_outpoint`. Absence alone never proves that an arbitrary outpoint exists and is unspent: `TransparentUnspentOutputsByOutpoint` is the direct durable spentness authority per [ADR-0026](../adrs/0026-utxo-set-commitment.md). A consumer that already holds the canonical output fact, such as `ExplorerQuery.TransactionDetail`, may interpret a successful complete lookup's absent spender as unspent at that epoch. Duplicate request outpoints collapse to one entry. Coinbase inputs spend no prevout and never appear in the spend-fact index; the coinbase sentinel outpoint is rejected with gRPC `INVALID_ARGUMENT` at the wallet adapter. One request is capped at `MAX_TRANSPARENT_OUTPUTS_PER_REQUEST = 1024`, identical to the prevout surface; callers with larger known output sets must issue epoch-pinned chunks and verify the complete epoch identity across every response.

The `ChainIndex` Rust API exposes `transparent_spends_by_outpoint(outpoints, at_epoch_id)`, returning `TransparentSpendsByOutpointResponse`; `RemoteChainIndex` calls the native gRPC method. The released serving-pair `WalletServingQuery` does not yet implement this canonical resolver, so `zinder-query` does not advertise the capability. The reverse-spend surface remains native-only for the same reason as prevout resolution.

## Transparent Unspent-Output Probe

The unspent-output probe is the gettxout-equivalent surface: given an `OutPoint`, it returns the referenced output only while that output is unspent on the canonical chain, and nothing if the output has been spent or never existed (null-if-spent). It composes the output resolver and the canonical reverse-spend reader on the server so a transparent-flow explorer issues one round-trip rather than an output lookup, a spend lookup, and a client-side join per outpoint.

- `WalletQuery.TransparentUnspentOutputsByOutpoint(TransparentUnspentOutputsByOutpointRequest) returns (TransparentUnspentOutputsByOutpointResponse)`. The legacy primary-store library handler can serve this operation because both canonical output and spend-fact resolvers are wired. The release serving-pair query omits `wallet.read.transparent_unspent_outputs_by_outpoint_v1` until it composes those resolvers.

The primary-store handler opens one epoch-bound reader and reads both `transparent_outputs_by_outpoints` and `transparent_spend_facts_by_outpoints` at that single pinned epoch. An outpoint emits an entry only when the output is present and carries no canonical spend at the epoch; spent or never-existed outpoints emit no entry, so every entry's `output` is populated. The response binds to a `ChainEpoch` at field tag 1, then carries `repeated TransparentOutputEntry entries`, the same entry shape as `TransparentOutputsByOutpoint` so consumers share one decoder. Consumers key results by `outpoint`; duplicate request outpoints collapse to one entry. The coinbase sentinel outpoint is rejected with gRPC `INVALID_ARGUMENT` at the wallet adapter and the request is capped at `MAX_TRANSPARENT_OUTPUTS_PER_REQUEST = 1024`, identical to the prevout and reverse-spend surfaces.

The read is canonical-only. The mempool overlay is intentionally absent: a mempool-aware caller composes this canonical probe with `TransparentMempoolSpendsByOutpoint` and subtracts those unmined spends from the result. The `ChainIndex` Rust API exposes `transparent_unspent_outputs_by_outpoint(outpoints, at_epoch_id)`, returning `TransparentUnspentOutputsByOutpointResponse`; `RemoteChainIndex` calls the native gRPC method. The released serving-pair `WalletServingQuery` does not yet implement this probe, so `zinder-query` does not advertise the capability. The surface is native-only for the same reason as prevout resolution.

## Chain Value Pools

The native schema contains `WalletQuery.ChainValuePoolsAtTip(ChainValuePoolsAtTipRequest) returns (ChainValuePoolsAtTipResponse)`, but the release composition does not advertise `wallet.read.chain_value_pools_at_tip_v1`.

The response binds to the query's admitted visible `ChainEpoch`, carries `source_tip: BlockTip`, and preserves `repeated ChainValuePool pools` in upstream order. `source_tip` is the `blocks` plus `bestblockhash` pair returned by the same `getblockchaininfo` response as the pool totals. A caller accepting the snapshot as canonical compares both its height and hash with the intended canonical tip; height equality alone is not sufficient across a reorg. Each pool entry carries `id`, `monitored`, and optional `chain_value_zat`. The list-shaped contract is intentional: consumers can render known pools by id without forcing Zinder to drop or rename future consensus pools.

OpenRPC method-name discovery does not prove that `getblockchaininfo` returns
the required `valuePools` payload, and the current readiness loop does not
retain a semantic value-pool probe. A later explorer slice may admit the method
only after a successful startup value-pool read on the exact installed source
and a matching retained readiness check. Until then, direct native calls fail
with `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `ENDPOINT_CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE` before node
I/O.

This live snapshot is a prerequisite fact, not a value-pool history or value-flow projection. Historical pool totals and per-period movements remain separate future consumers with independent coverage and replay semantics.

## Transparent Address Balance

The native surface is `WalletQuery.TransparentAddressBalance(TransparentAddressBalanceRequest) returns (TransparentAddressBalanceResponse)`. The request carries `repeated AddressLookup addresses` and an `optional uint64 at_epoch_id`. The response carries the binding `chain_view` at field tag 1, then `confirmed_zat: uint64`, `unconfirmed_delta_zat: int64`, and `address_count: uint32`.

The protocol and temporary generic primary-store composition retain
`wallet.address.transparent_balance_v1`, but the release `zinder-query`
endpoint does not advertise it. The legacy handler combines a pinned canonical
confirmed total with multiple live ingest-control calls; even when those calls
report the same chain epoch, they do not authenticate one mempool generation.
The admitted outputs-by-address and spends-by-outpoint primitives therefore do
not make the composite claim truthful. P2b must compose one coherent
canonical-and-mempool snapshot before the release endpoint can advertise the
balance. Direct calls currently fail the endpoint capability guard before
request parsing or provider access.

The address list is capped at 256 per request (`MAX_TRANSPARENT_ADDRESS_BALANCE_ADDRESSES`), enforced in the wallet/native layer. An over-cap list is rejected with `INVALID_ARGUMENT` carrying `TRANSPARENT_BALANCE_ADDRESS_COUNT_EXCEEDED`; an empty list is rejected with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. The signed delta saturates to the `int64` range; `confirmed_zat` is a `uint64`.

Mempool live state is not chain-epoch-pinnable. `at_epoch_id` pins only the
canonical confirmed read; it cannot fence a sequence of live writer calls.
Readiness proves that the admitted ingest control is healthy, but health is not
a response snapshot and cannot justify this capability. Historical balance at
an arbitrary height is out of scope.

The lightwalletd compat shim answers `GetTaddressBalance` and `GetTaddressBalanceStream` by calling the wallet primitive and projecting it into one `int64 value_zat` (confirmed total minus pending outflows, saturating to zero, capped at `i64::MAX`); pending inflows are ignored because the legacy lightwalletd balance field is confirmed-shaped and carries no overlay slot. `GetTaddressBalanceStream` collects the streamed addresses and uses the same projection as the unary call; it exists only for the lightwalletd contract.

The `ChainIndex` Rust API retains
`transparent_address_balance(addresses) -> TransparentAddressBalance` for the
protocol surface and legacy tests. `RemoteChainIndex` requires
`wallet.address.transparent_balance_v1` before invoking it, so the current
release endpoint rejects the operation during capability preflight. P2b owns
the coherent implementation and release admission proof.

## Capability Discovery

`WalletQuery.ServerInfo` returns a `ServerCapabilities` descriptor per [Public interfaces §Capability Discovery](public-interfaces.md#capability-discovery). Capability strings are exact-match; clients gate features on capability strings such as `wallet.events.chain_v1` rather than on Zinder version. The admitted query derives one immutable set from persisted storage evidence, implemented methods, and the exact probed providers installed in the composition. The native descriptor and operations endpoint share that exact immutable set without operator overrides or a copied support list. The descriptor's `node` field reports the upstream-node probe snapshot; an adapter constructed without source-probe results leaves it empty.

## Native Rust API

Rust integrations can call the remote-first `zinder-client` surface per [Public interfaces §Rust API Shape](public-interfaces.md#rust-api-shape). The `ChainIndex` trait exposes immutable network metadata and canonical reads with typed Rust values (`BlockHeight`, `ChainEpoch`, `TxStatus`, and `IndexerError`); `RemoteChainIndex` also implements `EndpointBackedIndex` for broadcast, subscriptions, and live state. Zinder's serving runtimes compose service-internal reads through `WalletServingQuery` and an admitted `WalletServingReadPair`, while consumers with dependency or toolchain conflicts can generate stubs from the native `WalletQuery` protocol instead of linking the SDK.

The `ChainIndex` trait does not duplicate the `WalletQueryApi` Rust trait inside `services/zinder-query`. They serve different boundaries: `WalletQueryApi` is the gRPC server's internal trait; `ChainIndex` is the public Rust API for consumers. Both share types from `zinder-core`. A compatibility test asserts that every advertised `ServerCapabilities` capability string has a corresponding `ChainIndex` method.

## Transaction Broadcast

Transaction broadcast is a network operation, not a canonical chain commit.

`zinder-query` may expose transaction broadcast because wallets expect a single endpoint. This is wallet operation parity, not part of the minimum read-only shielded sync surface. The broadcast path must:

- Forward the raw transaction to a configured network or upstream node path.
- Advertise `wallet.broadcast.transaction_v1` only after the configured source probe reports `transaction_broadcast`.
- Return `TransactionBroadcastOutcome` with accepted, duplicate, invalid-encoding, queued, rejected, or unknown outcomes.
- Avoid writing canonical chain state.
- Rely on ingestion to observe the transaction later in mempool or block data.

`zinder-source` owns source-specific broadcast I/O through `TransactionBroadcaster`. `zinder-query` may delegate to that boundary, but it must not embed Zebra or zcashd JSON-RPC behavior in query logic.

`zinder-compat-lightwalletd` exposes the same broadcast path as the
lightwalletd-compatible `SendTransaction`. The adapter only carries raw
transaction bytes through `WalletQueryApi::broadcast_transaction` and maps
typed outcomes to `lightwalletd::SendResponse` error codes. No viewing keys,
spending keys, or scanning material cross the Zinder boundary on this path; the
privacy contract from the read-sync surface applies unchanged.

Regtest can prove forwarding, typed rejection mapping, and the no-storage-mutation boundary. Testnet validation is required before Zinder promises public relay, stable fee-policy taxonomy, rebroadcast behavior, or accepted-transaction propagation semantics.

## Compatibility

`zinder-compat-lightwalletd` serves the vendored `CompactTxStreamer` proto from `zinder_proto::compat::lightwalletd` by translating `WalletQueryApi`. The full responsibility list, allowed request shapes, error mapping, and test surface are owned by [Protocol boundary §Lightwalletd Compatibility](protocol-boundary.md#lightwalletd-compatibility); native `WalletQueryApi` remains the primary API and new functionality lands there first.

v1 wallet APIs target self-hosted, single-operator deployments backed by a configured upstream node. The v1 binaries do not implement TLS termination, authentication, rate limiting, or quota accounting; an operator who needs any of those terminates them at a load balancer or reverse proxy in front of Zinder. Public-internet hosting requirements are out of v1 scope.

### External Wallet Compatibility Claims

This section is the canonical Zinder contract for external wallet serving
claims. Per [ADR-0005](../adrs/0005-consumer-neutral-wallet-data-plane.md),
the contract is consumer-neutral: client-specific validation belongs in test
evidence, while this document owns the durable serving criteria.

Zinder compatibility claims use these levels:

| Level | Meaning | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protocol-compatible` | Zinder builds and serves the pinned `lightwallet-protocol` messages without local schema drift. | Vendored proto drift check, generated client smoke tests, and protocol field golden tests. |
| `reference-parity-compatible` | Zinder behavior matches reference `lightwalletd` for the claimed RPC set, with documented allow-listed operator differences. | Live parity suite against pinned reference inputs. |
| `client-compatible` | Real lightwalletd-compatible wallet clients can create, restore, resync, send, and observe mempool behavior through Zinder. | Android SDK and Zodl evidence for the claimed network and complete wallet-serving coverage. |
| `public-operator-compatible` | A public deployment can safely expose the compatible endpoint. | TLS/proxy, bind, rate-limit, redaction, readiness, metrics, and operational runbook evidence. |

A release or deployment may advertise only the highest level whose required
evidence is current. Do not use unqualified "full compatibility" or "drop-in
replacement" language without naming the protocol pin, claimed RPC set, and
certification level.

A deployment may claim Android SDK or Zodl compatibility only when:

- The serving store contains the subtree-root history required by fresh wallet
  bootstrap and tree-state history for every anchor height a supported wallet
  flow can request, including create, resync, and restore/import flows. Use
  `zinder-ingest --wallet-serving` (or `ingest.run_overrides.coverage = "wallet-serving"`)
  for this serving profile; recent checkpoints are validation fixtures, not
  wallet-serving stores.
- The transparent output surface in [§Transparent Address Outputs](#transparent-address-outputs)
  is implemented end-to-end.
- The transport requirement in [Service operations](service-operations.md#deployment-guidance)
  is satisfied for real Zodl endpoint tests.

The upstream Go `lightwalletd/testclient` remains smoke coverage for the basic
compat surface. It is not a substitute for an Android SDK or Zodl bootstrap
test when the release claim names those clients.

A deployment may claim Android SDK or Zodl mempool compatibility only
when `GetMempoolStream` and `GetMempoolTx` are mapped over the native mempool
index and event log, and an SDK or app flow has observed mempool transactions
against that endpoint. A sync-only Zodl proof does not establish
pending-transaction UX.

## Query Consistency

Wallet sync APIs must read from one `ChainEpoch`. Primary in-process reads may also be backed by one RocksDB snapshot; secondary reads are snapshotless and rely on epoch-bound visibility retention per [ADR-0003](../adrs/0003-canonical-storage-access-boundary.md).

Rust consumers capture that boundary with `ChainSnapshot` for a borrowed
handle or `OwnedChainSnapshot` for an `Arc`-owned, cloneable chain view. Every
pinnable canonical method on either view sends `Some(captured_epoch.id)`,
including transaction lookup; snapshot transaction reads therefore never fall
back to the live mempool. The snapshot types do not wrap current-only address
history or balance reads or any `EndpointBackedIndex` operation.

For example, a compact block range response should bind:

- Start height.
- End height.
- Tip hash.
- Tip height.
- Settled tip height.
- Artifact schema version.
- Subtree-root range or cursor when subtree data is returned.

If the chain tip changes while the request is executing, the response should still finish from the epoch it started with or restart from a new epoch. It should not mix both.

The production `WalletServingQuery` publishes one current exact read pair and
does not promise historical pair retention. After publication advances, an old
snapshot receives `CHAIN_EPOCH_PIN_UNAVAILABLE` and captures a new snapshot;
it must not silently read replacement-branch artifacts.

## Performance and Pagination

`lightwalletd` compatibility is the floor for wallet-sync performance, not the target. Zinder publishes P50, P99, and worst-case budgets for hot wallet endpoints and gates `GetBlockRange`-equivalent behavior in CI.

### Enforced Regression Budgets

The `ci-perf` profile runs deterministic regression checks from
`services/zinder-query/tests/perf/perf_smoke.rs`. A 1,000-block compact range
must complete within 2 seconds, a 1,000-block full-block stream within 5
seconds, and a visible-tip read within 250 milliseconds. The full-block stream
also caps its channel at 4 chunks, so peak buffering cannot scale with the
requested range. These are deliberately generous CI ceilings, not percentile
claims about production hardware.

Live latency and mainnet catch-up tests measure real Zebra and RocksDB behavior
without publishing machine-specific observations as durable architecture.
Operators collect current P50, P99, worst-case, readiness, source-RPC, store,
and RocksDB evidence through the commands in the testing runbook before making
a release-performance claim.

Every range or list endpoint defines:

- A maximum response size.
- A cursor or explicit closed range.
- Stable ordering.
- The epoch or source timestamp that bounds the response.

The release native compact-block range API rejects requests above the fixed
1,000-block `DEFAULT_MAX_COMPACT_BLOCK_RANGE` before opening a reader.
Visible-tip reads use the epoch-bound pair directly. Tree-state reads first use
the same pinned pair, then fill a missing exact-height checkpoint through the
admitted upstream tree-state provider for the already-resolved canonical block.
Batched storage reads remain bounded by the range limit; native gRPC streams
one compact block per message instead of packing the whole range into a single
response.

The lightwalletd compatibility adapter must also keep unbounded upstream
semantics bounded at Zinder's boundary. For example, `GetSubtreeRoots` treats
`maxEntries = 0` as a bounded compatibility request, not permission to
materialize every retained subtree root.
`GetBlockRange` consumes the bounded native range result and streams decoded
lightwalletd blocks without a second full-range allocation. True per-item store
back-pressure requires an owned snapshot streaming read API; until then the
range cap is the memory bound.
`GetAddressUtxosStream` must follow the same rule: page or stream from a
bounded transparent output artifact read, never from an unbounded in-memory
address result.

Do not materialize an unbounded list and truncate it after the fact. The storage and protocol signatures should make that shape impossible.
