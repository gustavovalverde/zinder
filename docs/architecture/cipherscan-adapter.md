# Cipherscan Adapter Architecture

`zinder-compat-cipherscan` preserves the Cipherscan REST paths and JSON shapes
while reading chain data from Zinder's native APIs. Cipherscan can therefore
move its API base URL without a frontend migration. The adapter is an edge
translation service, not a second chain indexer and not a Cipherscan-shaped
Zinder core API.

## Boundaries

- **Zinder** owns canonical facts, durable reusable projections, capability and
  coverage metadata, epoch-coherent reads, and explicit absence. Native names
  remain product-neutral.
- **The adapter** owns HTTP routing, request coercion, Cipherscan response
  shapes, address encoding, display units, bounded product calculations,
  caches, and stable degraded responses. It does not infer unavailable facts
  or turn missing values into zeroes or empty successful results.
- **Sidecars** own product enrichments that are not Zcash chain facts, including
  labels, market data, mining attribution, external-node monitoring, names,
  bridges, and identity-oriented risk analytics. They do not require Zinder
  schema or projection changes.
- **Unavailable** marks an intentional boundary: the adapter returns an
  explicit unavailable or degraded response until an owner provides the source
  fact. It is not a request to synthesize an approximation in Zinder.

The adapter prefers one Zinder snapshot or epoch for a page response. When a
page needs a reusable chain fact that native queries cannot supply truthfully,
that fact is added as a narrow Zinder surface rather than joined from direct
Zebra calls or copied into adapter storage.

For arbitrary time-window block-production reads, projection identity, frozen
continuations, reorg handling, and completeness are defined by
[ADR 0033](../adrs/0033-time-indexed-block-production.md). This document only
records how the adapter consumes that contract. The executable acceptance
procedure lives in the
[Cipherscan adapter verification runbook](../runbooks/cipherscan-adapter-verification.md).

## Review Invariants

1. Native Zinder contracts carry chain facts, freshness, coverage, and absence;
   Cipherscan route names and presentation policy stop at the adapter boundary.
2. A response that cannot prove its requested data must expose the relevant
   capability, coverage, or unavailable state. It must not fabricate rows,
   zeroes, finality, prices, labels, or risk conclusions.
3. Reusable durable facts are projection-owned with reorg, checkpoint, and
   restart semantics. Product-only joins stay in the adapter or sidecar.
4. Displaced-block and displaced-root results are positive evidence within the
   archive activation range, not proof of complete historical fork coverage.
5. Sidecar and unavailable rows in the matrix are intentional scope boundaries;
   adding a Cipherscan route does not authorize new Zinder storage or a
   product-specific native API.
